Global governing body FIFA has opened a disciplinary case against Rubiales A players' union has said it would do all it could to ensure the kiss does ""not go unpunished""
Luis Rubiales had been under fire after kissing Hermoso on the lips while handing the team their medals after they beat England 1-0 in the final on Sunday in Sydney.
The incident sparked outrage within and outside Spain, with many, including government ministers, players and coaches, demanding his resignation and forcing the federation to call an emergency assembly on Friday, where Rubiales said the kiss was consensual and he was the victim of ""social assassination"".
Speaking at the assembly, Rubiales complained that ""false feminists"" were ""trying to kill me"".
He described the kiss as a ""little peck"" that was ""spontaneous, mutual, euphoric and consensual"".
""Is a consensual peck going to take me out of here? I won't resign. I will fight until the end,"" Rubiales said, drawing applause from the predominantly male audience.
The government has said it will take the incident before a sport tribunal where, if it can be proven the kiss was non-consensual, he could be tried under a sexual violence law introduced last year.
His speech drew immediate condemnation from acting Labour Minister Yolanda Diaz, who described it as ""unacceptable"".
""The government must act and take urgent measures: impunity for macho actions is over. Rubiales cannot continue in office,"" Diaz wrote on social media.
Rubiales, 46, said in his speech that Hermoso was the one who initiated physical contact by lifting him off the ground by his hips.
He said he asked Hermoso is he could give her ""a little peck"" and she said ""OK"".
Global governing body FIFA opened a disciplinary case against Rubiales on Thursday.
Its disciplinary committee is tasked with weighing whether Rubiales violated its code relating to ""the basic rules of decent conduct"" and ""behaving in a way that brings the sport of football and/or FIFA into disrepute"".
Spain's acting Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has called Rubiales's attempt to apologise, which came after criticism, unconvincing and that ""he must continue taking further steps"" to be held accountable.

A key contributor to Spain's win, Hermoso said ""I did not like it, but what could I do?"" about the kiss during a social media stream immediately after the incident.
An initial statement, released in Hermoso's name, then downplayed the incident.
Later, local sports website Relevo.com said the federation had coerced Hermoso into making the statement.

The federation has denied this to The Associated Press.
On Wednesday, Hermoso issued a statement through her players' union saying it would speak on her behalf.
The players' union said it would do all it could to ensure the kiss does ""not go unpunished"".
Rubiales was also seen kissing other players during post-match celebrations on the pitch.

He has been under fire after kissing player Jenni Hermoso on the lips following Spain's Women's World Cup win.
FIFA has initiated disciplinary proceedings against Rubiales over the incident.
The president of the Spanish soccer federation has refused to resign despite heavy criticism for kissing a player on the lips without her consent after the Women's World Cup final.
Luis Rubiales told an emergency general assembly of the federation ""I won't resign"" four times in quick succession, claiming he was a victim of a witch hunt by ""false feminists"".
Rubiales kissed forward Jenni Hermoso on the lips during the award ceremony after Spain beat England in the final in Sydney .
Several Spanish media outlets had reported on Thursday that Rubiales was planning to step down.
Instead, he told the overwhelmingly male assembly the kiss was ""mutual and with the consent"" of Hermoso.
Hermoso had said in a video streamed on social media last Sunday, ""I didn't like it, but what can I do"".

Rubiales, 46, has come under increasing pressure to leave his post since the incident.
FIFA, soccer's global governing body and organiser of the World Cup, opened a disciplinary case against him on Thursday.
Its disciplinary committee was tasked with weighing whether Rubiales violated its code relating to ""the basic rules of decent conduct"" and ""behaving in a way that brings the sport of football and/or FIFA into disrepute"".
FIFA's move came after Spain's acting prime minister Pedro Sanchez said Rubiales' attempt to apologise, which came after he initially insulted his critics, was unconvincing.
Shortly before the forced kiss Rubiales had grabbed his crotch in a lewd victory gesture while standing close to Spain's Queen Letizia and the 16-year-old Princess Sofia.
The combination of the gesture and the unsolicited kiss has made Rubiales a national embarrassment after his conduct was broadcast to a global audience, marring the team's achievement in winning the trophy .
The first attempt to respond to the scandal was a statement Spain's national federation released in the name of Hermoso in which she was quoted downplaying the incident.

Spanish football player Jenni Hermoso has called on the Royal Spanish Football Federation to take action against its president, Luis Rubiales, after he kissed her on the lips during celebrations of the country's Women's World Cup victory.
The incident sparked global outrage on Sunday when Rubiales, celebrating on stage with the Spanish women’s team following their one-nil win over England in the World Cup final, embraced Hermoso, clutched her head in his hands and gave her an unsolicited kiss on the mouth.

Hermoso initially voiced discomfort with the kiss, telling teammates in the locker room after the match that she “didn’t like it.""
Later, she seemed to downplay the incident, telling the media: “It was a totally spontaneous mutual gesture because of the immense joy that winning a World Cup brings.”
“The president and I have a great relationship, his behaviour with all of us has been outstanding and it was a natural gesture of affection and gratitude,” Hermoso said, according to comments provided by the federation to Spanish news agency EFE.
On Thursday, however, Hermoso broke a days-long silence to condemn Rubiales’ actions in a joint statement with women’s football union FUTPRO, who she said was defending her interests and being her interlocutors on this matter.
""From FUTPRO we express our firm and resounding condemnation of conduct that violates the dignity of women,” the statement reads.
""From our association, we ask the Royal Spanish Football Federation to implement the necessary protocols, ensure the rights of our players and adopt exemplary measures.”
""It is essential that our national team, current world champion, is always represented by figures that project values of equality and respect in all areas,” it continues.
“It is necessary to continue to advance in the fight for equality, a fight that our female players have led with determination, bringing us to the position we are in today.""
Rubiales apologised for the kiss on Monday, after initially brushing it off as “a kiss between two friends celebrating something,” and telling Spanish broadcaster COPE that anyone who saw it differently were “idiots and stupid people.”
""Surely I was wrong, I have to admit,"" Rubiales said in an apology video sent by the federation. ""It was without bad faith at a time of maximum effusiveness.""
Many people, however, including Spain’s acting prime minister Pedro Sanchez, dismissed the apology as insufficient.

“We’ve seen his apology and that’s not enough, he must be much clearer and convincing in apologising,” Sanchez said in a statement from Spain’s Moncloa Palace. “He must take more steps to clarify a behaviour that is unacceptable.”
Spain’s players union, which Rubiales used to head, were more direct in their criticisms, insisting that Rubiales should resign and calling for Spain’s Higher Council for Sports to take action if he didn’t.
“The incident regarding Jenni Hermoso is especially grave since she finds herself in a situation of vulnerability before a person in a position of power,” the union said.","25,14,1",3
SBS,05AM 26/08/23,"In a tribute, Vladimir Putin says Wagner boss 'made mistakes' as jet crash theories emerge",https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/vladimir-putins-tribute-to-wagner-boss-as-jet-crash-theories-emerge/zu3i8ozvh,6,"KEY POINTS Vladimir Putin pledges a thorough investigation into the jet crash that apparently killed Yevgeny Prigozhin.
It came as Russia's president delivered a mixed tribute to the paramilitary boss.
Authorities say Prigozhin was on the passenger list of a private jet that crashed on Thursday.
Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his condolences to the family of Yevgeny Prigozhin on Thursday, breaking his silence after the mercenary leader's plane crashed with no survivors two months after he led a mutiny against army chiefs.
Putin's comments, which suggested he harboured decidedly mixed feelings about Wagner's mercenary boss , were the most definitive yet on Prigozhin's fate. Before he spoke, the only official statement had come from the aviation authority which said Prigozhin had been on board the downed plane .
Who was Yevgeny Prigozhin?
Yevgeny Prigozhin spent nine years in prisons for crimes including robbery and fraud and was released in 1990, towards the end of the Soviet Union.
It was then he first met Vladimir Putin, who was then an aide to the mayor of St Petersburg. Prigozhin was later known as ""Putin's chef"" after catering for Kremlin events.
Prigozhin founded private military company Wagner in 2014, and its fighters have supported Russia's allies in Syria, Libya, and the Central African Republic.
Wagner also supported Russia in its invasion of Ukraine but, in June, the group's fighters took control of the southern city of Rostov-on-Don and shot down a number of military helicopters, killing their pilots, as they advanced towards Moscow.
Russian authorities said Prigozhin was on board a plane that crashed north of Moscow, two months after he led the mutiny against the Russian army.
Putin's mixed tribute to Prigozhin: 'He made serious mistakes'
Russian investigators have opened a probe into what happened, but have not yet said what they suspect caused the plane to suddenly fall from the sky northwest of Moscow on Wednesday evening.
Nor have they officially confirmed the identities of the 10 bodies recovered from the wreckage.
US officials told Reuters that Washington is looking at a number of theories over what brought down the plane, including a surface-to-air missile.
The US Department of Defense on Thursday said there was currently no information to suggest that a surface-to-air missile took down the plane.
The presumed death of Prigozhin leaves Russian President Vladimir Putin stronger in the short term, removing a powerful figure who launched a 23-24 June mutiny against the army's leadership and threatened to make him look weak.
But it would also deprive Putin of a forceful and astute player who had proved his utility to the Kremlin by sending his fighters into some of the bloodiest battles of the Ukraine war and by advancing Russian interests across Africa which are now likely to be re-organised.
It remains to be seen too how Wagner fighters, some of whom have already spoken of betrayal and foul play, react.
Pledging a thorough investigation which he said would take time, Putin said that ""preliminary data"" indicated that Prigozhin and other Wagner employees had been on the downed plane. The passenger list suggests that Wagner's core leadership team was flying with him too and had also perished.
Putin paid generous tribute to the renegade mercenary calling him a talented businessman who knew how to look after his own interests and who could, when asked, do his bit for the common cause.
Russian investigators have opened a probe into what happened, but have not yet said what they suspect caused the plane to suddenly fall from the sky. Source: AAP, SIPA USA / Kommersant Photo Agency But he also described Prigozhin as a flawed character who had made some bad mistakes.
""I want to express my most sincere condolences to the families of all the victims. It's always a tragedy,"" Putin said in televised remarks made during a meeting in the Kremlin with the Moscow-installed chief of Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine.
""I had known Prigozhin for a very long time, since the start of the 90s. He was a man with a difficult fate, and he made serious mistakes in life.""

Crash theories emerge
The Embraer Legacy 600 executive jet, which had been flying from Moscow to St Petersburg, crashed near the village of Kuzhenkino in the Tver region north of Moscow.
A Reuters reporter at the crash site on Thursday morning saw men carrying away black body bags on stretchers. Part of the plane's tail and other fragments lay on the ground near a wooded area where forensic investigators had erected a tent.
The Baza news outlet, which has good sources among law enforcement agencies, reported that investigators were focusing on a theory that one or two bombs may have been planted on board.
Residents of Kuzhenkino, the village near the crash site, said they had heard a bang and then saw the jet plummet to the ground. The plane showed no sign of a problem until a precipitous drop in its final 30 seconds, according to flight-tracking data.
One villager, who gave his name as Anatoly, said: ""It wasn't thunder, it was a metallic bang - let's put it that way.""
Mourners left flowers and lit candles near Wagner's offices in St. Petersburg and at other locations across Russia.
A Telegram channel linked to Wagner, Grey Zone, pronounced Prigozhin dead on Wednesday evening, hailing him as a hero and a patriot who had died at the hands of ""traitors to Russia"".

Prigozhin led an armed rebellion against Russian President Vladimir Putin in June, which Putin described as treason.
Many of Putin's enemies have died in mysterious circumstances over the years.
Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin is believed to have been killed in a plane crash north of Moscow on Wednesday evening.
He has not been confirmed dead but was on the plane's passenger list, and Russian authorities said there were no survivors.
Prigozhin was formerly an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin but became an enemy after launching an armed mutiny against the president in late June.
He's not the first of Putin's enemies to suffer a mysterious death or near-death experience.
What happened to Yevgeny Prigozhin?
Prigozhin was once a close associate of Putin, but became an enemy after leading what Russian officials described as an ""armed mutiny"" in June.
In 2014, he founded Wagner Group, a paramilitary organisation that has fought in Libya, Syria, the Central African Republic and Mali, among other countries.
The mercenaries were supporting the Kremlin in the war in Ukraine, until Prigozhin called for an armed rebellion and pledged to oust Russia's military leadership.
The mutiny was ended by an apparent Kremlin deal which saw Prigozhin agree to relocate to neighbouring Belarus.
Prigozhin posted a video address on Monday which he suggested was filmed in Africa.
Unconfirmed Russian media reports said that Prigozhin and his associates had attended a meeting on Wednesday with officials from the Russian Defence Ministry.
Online flight tracker Flightradar24 showed that the Embraer plane (registration number RA-02795) carrying Prigozhin had dropped off the radar at 6:11pm MSK (Thursday, 1:11am AEST).
There were reportedly 10 people on board, and Prigozhin's name was on the passenger list.
Rescuers had recovered seven bodies from the scene, TASS reported.
Amid fevered speculation and an absence of verifiable facts, some have pointed the finger of blame at the Russian state, others at Ukraine which was due to mark its Independence Day on Thursday.
Alexei Navalny poisoned in Siberia
Russia's most prominent opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, was flown to Germany in August 2020 for medical treatment after being poisoned in Siberia with what Western experts concluded was the military nerve agent Novichok .
Russia has denied any involvement.
Navalny voluntarily returned to Russia in 2021 and was immediately arrested on arrival.
In early August, Navalny had an extra 19 years in a maximum security penal colony added to his jail term.
He was already serving sentences totalling 11-and-a-half years on fraud and other charges that he says are also bogus. His political movement has been outlawed and declared ""extremist"".
Sergei Skripal's Novichok poisoning
A former Russian double agent who passed secrets to British intelligence, Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a bench outside a shopping centre in the English cathedral city of Salisbury in March 2018.
They were taken to hospital in critical condition, and British officials said they had been poisoned - like Navalny - with Novichok, a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet military in the 1970s and 1980s.

Russia has denied any role in the poisoning and said Britain was whipping up anti-Russian hysteria.
Pavel Antov's hotel death
Russian politician and millionaire Pavel Antov had been critical of Putin's war with Ukraine.
In June 2022, Russian media published a WhatsApp message attributed to Antov that said a Kremlin missile bombardment on Ukraine was ""terrorism"".
Antov took to the Russian social media network VK to deny writing the message, insisting that he supported Russia's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

In December 2022, he died after reportedly falling from a hotel room in India.
The 65-year-old's body was found in a pool of blood outside his lodgings in the eastern state of Odisha, where he was on holiday with three other Russian nationals.
His death came two days after another member of the travel party, Vladimir Bidenov, was found unconscious after suffering an apparent heart attack.
Deaths in oil and energy industry
In September 2022, Ravil Maganov - chairman of oil company Lukoil - died after falling from a hospital window in Moscow, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters, confirming reports by several Russian media.
But circumstances surrounding his fall were unclear.
Lukoil took a public stand over Russia's actions in Ukraine. Source: AAP / Stephanie Lecocq / EPA Russian state news agency TASS reported the death as a suicide, citing a law enforcement source.
In a statement, the company said he died ""following a severe illness"".
A former board member of Lukoil, Alexander Subbotin, was found dead in Moscow in May 2022.
Lukoil had taken a public stand over Russia's actions in Ukraine, with the company's board of directors expressing its concern over the ""tragic events"" and calling for the ""soonest possible end to armed conflict"".
There have also been several deaths reported tied to Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom.
Gazprom's head of transport Leonid Shulman was found dead in a cottage, and executive Alexander Tyulakov was found dead in his St. Petersburg home the morning after Russia invaded Ukraine.
The Polish plane crash
In 2010, Poland's president Lech Kaczyński and 95 others were killed in a plane crash in Russia.
Polish officials said the crash was a ""political assassination"" orchestrated by the Kremlin.
Russia has denied the allegations.
In 2022, a Polish government commission released a report alleging an intentional detonation of planted explosives caused the crash.
The poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko
Alexander Litvinenko, an ex-KGB agent and outspoken critic of Putin, died in 2006 aged 43 after drinking green tea laced with polonium-210, a rare and potent radioactive isotope, at London's Millennium Hotel, British officials have said.
Putin probably approved the killing, a British inquiry concluded in 2016.
The Kremlin has denied involvement.
READ MORE What were Yevgeny Prigozhin and his Wagner mercenaries doing in Africa?
An inquiry led by a senior British judge found that former KGB bodyguard Andrei Lugovoy and another Russian, Dmitry Kovtun, carried out the killing as part of an operation that he said was probably directed by Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB.
Litvinenko fled Russia for Britain six years to the day before he was poisoned.
Whistleblower killed while jogging
Alexander Perepilichny was found dead near his luxury home in an exclusive gated estate outside London after he had been out jogging in November 2012.
The 44-year-old Russian sought refuge in Britain in 2009 after helping a Swiss investigation into a Russian money laundering scheme.
His sudden death raised suggestions he might have been murdered.
British police ruled out foul play despite suspicions he might have been murdered with a rare poison.
A pre-inquest hearing heard that traces of a rare and deadly poison from the gelsemium plant were found in his stomach.
Perepilichny had enjoyed a large bowl of soup containing sorrel, a popular Russian dish.
Russia denied involvement.

The Guardian,05AM 26/08/23,"‘To Marley, Andrea is everything’: the Italian father fighting to stay with his Australian son",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/26/andrea-tindiani-immigration-australia-marley-daughter,5,"When Andrea Tindiani and his nine-year-old son, Marley, get together the pace is fast. Last weekend Marley wanted to head to the nearest trampoline centre. Other days it might be swimming, fishing or kicking a ball in the park.
“I want to expose him to as wide a variety of experiences as possible,” says Tindiani.
Every Friday, Tindiani leaves his home in the Victorian town of Castlemaine to reach Marley’s primary school south-west of Ballarat by pickup time. Then they drive back to Castlemaine. It’s a three-hour round trip that Tindiani repeats early on Monday morning, so Marley is at school before the bell.
“My own father was pretty absent during my childhood,” says Tindiani. “I’m determined not to have Marley repeat that experience.”
From Monday to Thursday, Marley lives with his mother, Emily Kay, and two siblings, who rarely see their own fathers. Tindiani has been the one consistent man in their lives, says Kay. “He’s really been a dad to them all.”
After 11 years in Australia, time is running out for Tindiani. The 38-year-old is on the brink of being forced to return to Italy and leave Marley behind. Tindiani has jumped across a series of temporary visas to stay close to his son, but never managed the leap to permanent residence, and he has nearly exhausted his options to remain in Australia. He is one of “too many” migrants stuck in what the home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, calls “permanently temporary limbo”, a state she cites as an example of the migration program failing to align with Australian values.
Marley is an Australian citizen, Tindiani has always shared his care and Kay needs him as co-parent. Yet under immigration rules, none of these factors help him get a visa.

Stephanie Lee, a senior solicitor at Sydney’s Immigration Advice and Rights Centre (IARC), says there are many temporary migrants with Australian children in similar circumstances and many are much more vulnerable than Tindiani.
“We see people in this situation every week. It’s very often women escaping domestic violence who have fled an abusive partner,” she says.
Lee says these parents face an invidious choice – either separate from their Australian child or try to live below the radar and stay in Australia unlawfully.
The only person who can help is the immigration minister, Andrew Giles, who has the power to grant a visa using one of his public interest powers, sometimes called “God powers” because of their fateful impact on people’s lives. Yet getting to the minister can be a long and circuitous process.
Falling through a gap
Tindiani’s Australian story begins in July 2012. He arrived on a working holiday visa, spent time fruit picking and met Kay at a New Year’s Eve party. In 2013 they moved in together. By then, Tindiani had a four-year temporary skills visa, sponsored by Black & Decker, a firm he’d worked for in Italy. With a prospect this would lead to permanent residency, the couple saw no need to apply for a partner visa, especially given the cost (currently $8,850).
They could not know that they were about to fall through a gap in Australia’s immigration system.
Soon after Marley’s birth in mid-2014, the couple split up. “It was my call,” says Kay. “Andrea went through a bit of heartbreak, but he picked up and went straight into continuously being an awesome father.”
‘I’m keeping strong and keeping present, especially when I’m with Marley,’ Tindiani says. Photograph: Penny Stephens/The Guardian
The couple kept sharing a house for several months and needed no lawyers to sort out parenting arrangements. “There’s never any conflict,” says Kay. When she moved to Yamba on the New South Wales north coast, Tindiani would visit Marley every fortnight, driving seven hours from work in Sydney on Friday afternoon and heading back before dawn on Monday.
In 2016, redundancies at Black & Decker cost Tindiani his job and his right to a skilled migrant visa. He switched back to the working holiday scheme, entitled to a second 12-month visa because he had worked on farms for three months. Had Tindiani and Kay applied for a partner visa when they were still a couple, they would not be in the fix they are in now. Even if their relationship had ended before the visa was granted, the application itself would have provided a relatively straightforward path to permanent residence, because of Tindiani’s obligations to his Australian child.
In the absence of an application for a partner visa, Tindiani had no way of seeking to remain in Australia permanently. So to be close to Marley, he stayed on a succession of student visas, gaining qualifications in sports coaching, yoga teaching and communications. He built a career in “men’s work”, facilitating programs to build men’s emotional intelligence, fitness and mental health. He also works two days a week managing a hospitality venue in Daylesford.
Tindiani’s unblemished migration record, skills and work experience do not meet the threshold for a permanent visa. His last hope of staying a fully engaged father to Marley is now intervention by Giles. But the minister can only intervene after a visa application is rejected at every stage.
“You have to do a baseless, non-meritorious application to get to the minister,” explains accredited immigration law specialist Joseph Italiano, who represents Tindiani.
Italiano helped Tindiani apply for a confirmatory residence visa intended for residents of Norfolk Island. “I chose a visa that didn’t cost much, knowing that Andrea was ineligible,” says the lawyer. The strategy was to open up the possibility of ministerial intervention as quickly and cheaply as possible.
I live with uncertainty, stuck in a place where I have very little control Andrea Tindiani
When Tindiani’s application was rejected, they sought a review of the decision at the migration and refugee division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, joining a backlog of almost 60,000 cases. This sat uncomfortably with Italiano, who spent 10 years sitting on the tribunal himself.
“People like my client are forced to clog up the queue,” says Italiano. “Believe me, if there was a pathway to go to the minister directly, I would have done that.”
In July, the tribunal rejected Tindiani’s review and referred the case to the minister. This is what Tindiani and Italiano had been hoping for.
Giles has the power to grant any visa he chooses, though there is no telling if or when the minister will consider Tindiani’s case. But it is Giles and Giles alone who can intervene; in April, the high court ruled the minister must make each decision personally rather than delegate them to the department. (The minister declined to comment, citing privacy reasons.)
‘A really common problem’
Between taking office in May 2022 and June this year, Giles received more than 4,300 requests for intervention under five separate public interest powers, but only about 3,300 requests were finalised under those powers over the same period, suggesting a growing backlog of cases. (Home Affairs was unable to say how many requests await the minister’s attention and this data is calculated from the department’s answer to a question on notice posed on 20 June by Coalition senator James Paterson.)
While Tindiani waits for his folder to rise to the top of the minister’s pile, he lives on a succession of short-term bridging visas.

IARC’s Lee wants to see a simple pathway to residency for the foreign parents of Australian children. “This is a really common problem,” she says. “It’s baffling that there isn’t a visa option for them to stay together with their children.”
Italiano says both sides of politics have long ignored this gap in migration law; a gap he says could be closed without legislation, by amending the partner visa regulations. “You can’t have hundreds of applications going to the minister. It’s no way to run government.”
Tindiani and Kay are honest with Marley about what is going on. “We tell him everything,” says Tindiani. “We’re not saying Dad’s going to leave. We give him a message of truth and hope.
“Marley’s probably not focusing on the fact that I might not be here, but his behaviour shows he’s a bit anxious.”
Kay dreads the prospect that her son’s father will be forced to leave Australia.
“To Marley, Andrea is everything,” she says.
Tindiani, meanwhile, looks drawn. He is not sleeping well and struggling to throw off a persistent cough. As well as holding down two jobs, he works long hours on his visa campaign and devotes weekends to his son.
“I’m keeping strong and keeping present, especially when I’m with Marley,” he says, “but it’s costing me a lot.”
“I’m living day by day. Nothing is guaranteed. “I live with uncertainty, stuck in a place where I have very little control.”
Tindiani says what is at play is the right to family life.

40m ago 03.31 AEST The Turkish and Ukrainian foreign ministers said on Friday that other solutions to the export of Ukrainian grain than the Black Sea grain deal, which ended after Russia quit last month, were less optimal. The deal brokered by Turkey and the UN last year had allowed the safe Black Sea export of Ukrainian grain. Ankara has been trying to persuade Moscow to return to the agreement. Ukraine announced earlier this month a “humanitarian corridor” in the Black Sea to release cargo ships that have been trapped in its ports since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The first vessel that used the corridor arrived in Istanbul last week. In a news conference during his visit to Kyiv, the Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, said renewing the grain deal was a priority for Ankara and that Russia must be included in the equation for a functioning agreement.

2h ago 02.30 AEST Second plane linked to Prigozhin 'has no connection to Wagner', says airline CEO A second plane linked to Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin by some Russian media has no connection to the mercenary group and never did, the CEO of the aircraft operator company told Reuters. Russia’s aviation authority has said Prigozhin was on board a private Embraer jet which crashed on Wednesday evening north-west of Moscow with no survivors. An investigation has yet to definitively identify the 10 people on board, but the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has sent condolences to their families. Russian media, mainly associated with the Wagner group’s Telegram channel, Grey Zone, had linked a second business jet with the tail number RA-02748 with the mercenary group, and had reported that it was also in the air at the time of the crash.

This plane had not been rented out, Trifonov said, though he declined to say who its owner was. The RA-02748 was landing in St Petersburg on Wednesday evening on a flight from Moscow when the plane believed to be carrying Prigozhin crashed, flight tracking data shows. It then took off to fly back to Moscow about 20 minutes later.

Photograph: Ints Kalniņš/Reuters Reznikov said he believed that Prigozhin’s presumed demise had weakened the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. “Because it has shown the world: if Putin does a deal with someone and breaks the deal, then that means that he cannot be trusted,” said Reznikov in extracts of the interview released by the newspaper before its publication on Sunday.

3h ago 01.08 AEST Germany’s top security official says she hopes prosecutors will find sufficient evidence to indict whomever carried out the attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea last year. Explosions on 26 September 2022 damaged the pipelines, which were built to carry Russian natural gas to Germany. Whom was responsible for the sabotage – which added to tensions over the war in Ukraine as European countries moved to wean themselves off Russian energy sources – remains a mystery. Germany, Sweden and Denmark have investigated the attack, though they have been tight-lipped about their findings. “I hope that the [German] federal prosecutor will find enough clues to indict the perpetrators,” the German interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said in an interview with Der Spiegel magazine published on Friday. “We must bring such crimes to court,” she said. “It also strengthens citizens’ confidence in the state of law when it succeeds in clearing up such complex cases.” In July, European diplomats told the UN security council that investigators found traces of undersea explosives in samples taken from a yacht that was searched as part of the probe. But they said it wasn’t yet possible to “reliably establish” the identity or motives of the perpetrators, or whether a specific country was involved.

After a video meeting with his counterparts from Romania, Slovakia and Hungary, as well as Bulgaria, a country not bordering Ukraine, the minister said they came to a joint position on the matter. “We support extending the [grain] import ban to our countries until the end of the year,” Robert Telus told reporters. The restrictions are set to expire on 15 September, AFP reports. In June, the EU agreed to restrict imports of grain from Ukraine to five member states seeking to protect their farmers who blamed those imports for the slump in prices on local markets.

4h ago 00.36 AEST I urged Prigozhin to 'watch out', says Belarus leader The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said on Friday that he warned the Wagner group chiefs Yevgeny Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin to watch out for possible threats to their lives, and he insisted that Wagner fighters would remain in Belarus. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, initially vowed to crush Prigozhin’s June mutiny, comparing it to the wartime turmoil that ushered in the revolution of 1917, but hours later a deal was clinched to allow Prigozhin and some of his mercenaries to go to Belarus. Prigozhin, Lukashenko said on Friday, had twice dismissed concerns raised by the Belarusian leader about possible threats to his life. Lukashenko said that during the mutiny he had warned Prigozhin that he would “die” if he continued to march on Moscow, to which he said Prigozhin had answered: “To hell with it – I will die.” Belarus’ president Alexander Lukashenko at his residence, the Independence Palace, in the capital Minsk on 6 July 2023. Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images Then, Lukashenko said, when Prigozhin and Utkin, who helped found Wagner and was also listed as a passenger on the plane which crashed, had come to see him, he had warned them both: “Lads – you watch out.” It was not exactly clear from Lukashenko’s words, which were reported by state news agency BELTA, when that conversation took place, Reuters reports. Lukashenko – an old acquaintance of Prigozhin and a close ally of Russia – said that Putin had nothing to do with the plane crash. “I know Putin: he is calculating, very calm, even tardy,” Lukashenko said. “I cannot imagine that Putin did it, that Putin is to blame. It’s just too rough and unprofessional a job.”

Russian investigators have confirmed the death of the pilot of the plane that crashed with the loss of all onboard including Prigozhin, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.
German prosecutors say they are investigating the attempted murder of Berlin-based Russian journalist Elena Kostyuchenko after she was one of three Russian-exile journalists who experienced symptoms consistent with poisoning.
Poland’s domestic security agency is investigating whether an outbreak of legionnaires’ disease that has killed seven people in the south of the country could be the result of intentional tampering with the water system, authorities said on Friday.
The UK’s defence ministry has said there is not yet definitive proof Prigozhin was onboard a plane that crashed with no survivors earlier this week but it is “highly likely” he is dead, Reuters reports.
The US state department on Thursday imposed sanctions on 13 people and entities it said were reportedly connected to the forced deportation and transfer of Ukraine’s children, as Washington ramps up pressure on Moscow over its invasion.

5h ago 22.51 AEST Amid the death of the Wagner group leader, some other groups are already sprouting, calling themselves Redut, Convoy or Patriot, although little information is available on their composition. Lou Osborn, from the open-source group All Eyes on Wagner, told AFP these companies “have much less presence and are less successful than Wagner but they follow the same construction”, noting the arrival of defectors from Wagner and also their close links with GRU Russian military intelligence. Lucas Webber, one of the co-founders of the Militant Wire research network, said Russian far-right movements within the military sphere on the internet were now bitterly mourning the deaths of the group’s leaders. “These elements portray the Russian political and military elite as decadent, corrupt and detached from the realities of the battlefield. “In contrast, they respected Prigozhin as a gritty character who cared about his men’s lives, was not afraid to criticise the military leadership and would frequently visit his fighters on the frontline.”
Updated at 23.20 AEST
6h ago 22.31 AEST Analysts say that while the Wagner mercenary group’s brand is inevitably going to be weakened by the death of its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, its previous successes will serve to inspire other mercenary groups affiliated to the Russian state to emerge, albeit in a different format with likely greater Kremlin control. “This process may also involve rebranding, and companies within the Wagner orbit may divide into separate entities based on functional area, which may be nationalised or maintained as quasi-independent entities,” Catrina Doxsee, an associate director and associate fellow with the Transnational Threats Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told AFP. But she added that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had likely seen in the June mutiny “the danger” in allowing so much power and responsibility to reside with one man. “Although Russia is likely to seek to continue its PMC [private military company] model for foreign policy and security assistance, it is likely that the marketplace of PMCs will diversify away from Wagner’s monopoly to prevent a repetition of Prigozhin’s challenge to the regime,” she added.

The Guardian,05AM 26/08/23,Trump’s mugshot reviewed: ‘More like a foolish old man with anger issues than a presidential contender’,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/25/trump-mugshot-reviewed-fry-blackadder-melchett-fulton,3,"We do not know if Donald Trump’s hairdresser and makeup artists blow-dried and primped the former US president on his flight from Mar-a-Lago to Atlanta, but it seems likely. By the time he surrendered at Fulton, like that other fading star Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard, Trump was ready for his close-up. The celebrity mugshot, after all, is more about performance art and political statement than mere police documentation.
Trump makes the best of what he has. Or his people do. Is it possible they brokered a deal with the sheriff to change the wattage of the overhead lightbulb to make it less harsh? Boldly leaning forward so we can study his thatch, and see where toupee ends and pate begins, it’s a performance that perhaps, like his hairpiece, is poised to become unstuck. The red-rimmed eyes suggest tiredness. Perhaps – let me dream – he’s been crying over his comeuppance. And the sternness of the expression seems almost self-satirising.

Trump’s gaze seems risible precisely because he is trying so hard to look serious. In this, he’s channelling the spirits of long-dead virtuosos of the mugshot. In Stalin’s, from 1911, we see the tousle-haired revolutionary arrested by Tsarist police for fomenting unrest. His stare – like Trump’s but more calm and scornful – suggests the establishment has no authority over him. In Martin Luther King’s 1956 mugshot, taken after his arrest during bus boycotts, he stares back at the cops who booked him, and by extension white America, with a hint of scorn and rage but with dignity nonetheless.
Trump could do with a little of that dignity in his self-righteous fury. Yet King’s dignity is beyond Trump – and nor can the ex-president look quite as scary as Stalin. At least he was able to avoid the rookie mistakes made by, for example, wild-haired James Brown caught unawares. Trump, for all his shortcomings, isn’t naive enough to let himself be captured for posterity like that.
Instead, he quotes from mugshot history. Yet, for all that it is a performance, Trump is no Cindy Sherman role-playing magnificently for the camera. The problem is he just isn’t very good at all this. Glaring crossly beneath arched eyebrows as if staring down a flunky who’s served up a cold burger, Trump looks as out of his element as the constipated Duke of Wellington in the portrait by Goya. He may be aiming for the moral uprightness of Lorenzo Lotto’s Portrait of a Woman Inspired by Lucretia, yet he looks as pompous and silly as Stephen Fry playing General Melchett in Blackadder.
As a work of art, it’s not clear what the photographer’s role here is, but it’s hard not to think whoever pushed the button intended to make the sitter look ridiculous. If so, well done: this anonymous artist has made the once most powerful man in the world look like a foolish old duffer with anger issues rather than a serious presidential contender.
Simplicity and power … Jane Fonda gets it right in her iconic shot. Photograph: AP
The sitter’s role here is to wrest control of his image from the plod snapper, but Trump hasn’t got the chutzpah. When Jane Fonda was busted on trumped-up charges of drug smuggling in 1970, she appeared holding a clenched fist aloft, glaring. Trump, unable to master the simplicity and power of that pose, looks what Fonda doesn’t – laughable.
Clearly Trump thinks the image will help the brand and, by extension, his bid to become president once more. The pose Trump has struck is, to be fair, honoured by history, which teaches: “Don’t be a mug and smile.” Go for passport photo solemnity, but with added gravitas. These truths were recognised by French criminologist Alphonse Bertillon when he invented, or rather standardised, the mugshot in 1888. But they were ignored by some of the worst criminals in history.
Imperious smirk … Paris Hilton in a booking photo released by Las Vegas police in 2010. Photograph: Las Vegas Police/AFP/Getty
The American mafia gangster John Gotti grins foolishly for his 1990 mugshot, while drug lord Pablo Escobar leers. The expression on Al Capone’s face says: “How could a chubby-baby-faced poppet like me be guilty of anything, least of all tax fraud?” It also says that he ain’t intimidated by no cop. Paris Hilton smirks imperiously, after being arrested in Vegas in 2010, as if to say to whomever is taking her picture: “Really?”( or perhaps: “Rilly?)
The only smiling mugshot that does its subject any favours is the one of Bill Gates in Albuquerque in 1977, for driving without a license and running a stop sign. His geeky grin rhymes with his terrible glasses – all fitting emblems for the nerd who, a year later, moved his startup company Microsoft to Seattle and conquered the world.
Two of Trump’s 18 co-defendants didn’t get the no-smiles memo. His former lawyer Jenna Ellis grins broadly, as does David Shafer, former chairman of the Georgia Republican party. At best, their poses suggest they’re playing innocent, but it comes across in both cases as witlessness in the face of quite serious indictments. To be fair, neither seem quite so criminal as another of the co-accused, Rudy Giuliani, who looks as if he’s just come off set as the Joker after shooting a scene in which Batman finally sees him off.
The trick of the mugshot, which Trump realises, is to look as though you’re 100% not guilty. Indeed, the mugshot must be understood not as shaming moment but as opportunity for promotion. Mick Jagger and Frank Sinatra are outliers in this respect. Arrested for amphetamine possession in 1967, Jagger more or less wittingly used the mugshot as an opportunity to present his incredibly fetching pouting lips, hollowed cheeks and general aura of bad-boy sexiness, all commensurate with his band’s image.

Yet at the same time, Jagger’s mugshot also served as a depiction of youthful vulnerability. Indeed, busted on dodgy drugs charges, Jagger managed to gain the support of William Rees-Mogg, who wrote a leader for the Times under the headline “Who Breaks a Butterfly on a Wheel?”, indicting those who were indicting and saying they were in the wrong, not lovely Mick. And so it proved: Mick got the charges overturned on appeal.
Similarly, when Sinatra was busted in 1938 for “seduction”, his mugshot showed a transgressive bad boy with eyes you could write poetry about. At least until you read the FBI report, which asserts that “under the promise of marriage” Sinatra “did then and there have sexual intercourse with the said complainant, who was then and there a single female of good repute”.
No celebrity mugshot, though, can match in adorableness those taken by Holly Hunter, playing a cop in the 1987 film Raising Arizona, shooting recidivist Nicolas Cage. “Turn to the right!” shouts Hunter as she takes his mugshot. “You’re a flower, you are,” replies Cage, already in love. “Just a little desert flower.” That, to be sure, is not really in the Trump playbook.",7,1
The Guardian,05AM 26/08/23,How did Australia’s university system get so broken?

In the faculty of arts, the Melbourne law school, student services and library services we’ll stay out for a week – longer than any previous dispute at an Australian university.
Readers of a certain age might marvel at the recent wave of industrial action in higher education, perhaps remembering their own campus days with fond nostalgia.
But the system they recall no longer exists.
Across the sector, casual and sessional staff now deliver between 50% and 80% of undergraduate teaching. Many tutors don’t know from semester to semester whether they’ll have jobs – an insecurity that can last decades. Often they work at multiple institutions, assembling a patchwork of contracts through which to support themselves.
Naturally, such conditions affect students, many of whom now face the unexpected indexation of the huge debts they’ve run up to attend higher education in Australia – and in return receive minimal attention from staff. In some places, sessional employees have been allocated just 10 minutes to read an assignment and provide feedback.
Widespread precarity has facilitated a culture of illegal underpayment, with more than $80m in underpayments uncovered since 2020 across public universities, according to the National Tertiary Education Union’s wage theft report. The University of Melbourne alone has been forced to repay $45m in stolen wages.
Both permanent and casual staff report being constantly overworked. A recent open letter signed by more than 100 members of the Melbourne law school says: “In our experience … many full-time employees work well in excess of 50 hours per week; many part-time employees work full-time hours; and increasingly, we hear of colleagues working during annual and long service leave and not taking sick leave when ill.”
How did higher education get so broken? Pretty much the same way as everything else. We live amid the wreckage of formerly treasured institutions and services, despoiled by decades of marketisation and neglect.
Think of universal healthcare, something of which Australians were once rightly proud. Like education, the system looks serviceable enough if you squint at it from the outside. But behind the veneer, healthcare workers report ongoing staff shortages in chronically underfunded hospitals, with beds often unavailable and emergency departments stretched beyond capacity.
Back in 1945, Ben Chifley explained that every man and woman possessed “an indefeasible right” to social security.
“Deprivation of those rights or whittling down of the terms of those provisions would,” he said, “be a breach of trust with the whole Australian nation.”
Today, in a far, far richer country than Chifley could ever have imagined, the majority of those receiving jobseeker and parenting payments live below the Henderson poverty line. As a recent government report explained, many of the unemployed lack the ability to meet “the essentials of life”.
We don’t have to accept the transformation of our institutions into corporations enriching the few while others have to strike for basic conditions
During the second world war, the old Commonwealth Housing Commission described the provision of affordable housing as a fundamental responsibility of government. “We consider,” it explained, “that a dwelling of good standard and equipment is not only the need but the right of every citizen – whether the dwelling is to be rented or purchased, no tenant or purchaser should be exploited for excessive profit.”
In 2023, almost three-quarters of young people believe they’ll never own a home. As for rent, Anglicare’s Kasy Chambers says bluntly: “Virtually no part of Australia is affordable for aged care workers, early childhood educators, cleaners, nurses and many other essential workers we rely on.”
Once upon a time, even Bob Menzies could urge funding for universities on the basis that they upheld “values which are other than pecuniary”.
But Menzies’ Tory paternalism suffered the same fate as Curtin and Chifley’s social democratic reformism, supplanted by a philosophy that considers “values other than pecuniary” a category error.
Higher education duly evolved into a huge industry, raking in billions from the lucrative overseas student market. Jockeying for profit, the universities employed the same strategies as other corporations, spending millions on consultants, including from scandal-ridden companies like PwC.
FOI documents from 2018-19 and 2019-20 revealed the extraordinary remuneration of top university executives: the 50 highest-paid employees at Sydney, Queensland and UNSW took home $350,000 a year, even before super and other benefits.
Many vice-chancellors receive huge bonuses on top of their already engorged salaries.
The University of Sydney pays Mark Scott a salary of $1.1m including bonuses; at Melbourne University, Duncan Maskell takes home $1.5m annually. Yet both Sydney and Melbourne feature among the worst-rated campuses in surveys of undergraduate experiences.
It doesn’t have to be like this. We don’t have to accept the transformation of our institutions into corporations enriching the few while others have to strike for basic conditions.

Bugsy Siegel peering malevolently from beneath his fedora in a 1928 booking photo summed up the perverse romance of gangsters in the prohibition age.
Nearly half a century later, mugshots of David Bowie, elegantly dressed but dead-eyed after his arrest for drug possession, and a dishevelled Janis Joplin, detained for “vulgar and indecent language”, spoke to the shock waves created by 1960s counterculture.
Now comes what Donald Trump Jr described as “the most iconic photo in the history of US politics” before the booking picture of his father glaring into the camera was even taken. But whether deeply divided Americans view the first ever mugshot of a former president as that of a gangster or a rock star is very much in the politics of the beholder.
Trump’s hostility shines through as he turns his eyes up toward the camera above him and in his taut, downturned mouth as he is booked into the Fulton county jail on charges of trying to steal the 2020 presidential election. Dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie, he makes no attempt to put on a smile like some of his co-defendants in their mugshots.
The picture does not flatter but it does convey the message many of Trump’s supporters want to hear – belligerence.

The six-pointed star of the Fulton county sheriff’s office badge and the name of the sheriff, Patrick Labat, sits in the top left hand corner of the picture. But some will be disappointed that Trump is not seen in the classic pose holding a board in front of his chest with his name and date of arrest.
Still, the mugshot will now enter the pantheon of famous-name booking photos, alongside Frank Sinatra looking unperturbed after his arrest in 1938 for “carrying on with a married woman”, and Hugh Grant after he was found with a sex worker on Sunset Boulevard. Trump has some way to go to catch up with the American actor Lindsay Lohan’s eight-year run of mugshots for theft, drugs and driving offences.
The former president’s supporters are already embracing the booking photo as a badge of honour and defiance. It will be held up as evidence that their man will not give up the fight against a system his followers see as ever more determined to bring him down and prevent him returning to the White House.
Far-right congresswoman Lauren Boebert led the way with a tweet proclaiming: “Not all heroes wear capes.”
The president’s detractors, on the other hand, will see the booking photo as evidence that even a man who was once the most powerful person in the land cannot escape the might of the justice system. Some will welcome anything that makes him look even a little bit more criminal as a confirmation that sooner or later he is going to prison. The accused may be presumed innocent until a plea or a jury says otherwise but mugshots can have a way of conveying guilt.

For Trump though, the picture is likely to prove yet another money spinner. Within hours, his campaign fundraising website was advertising T-shirts, bumper stickers and coffee mugs glorifying a martyred Trump with the booking photo above the words “never surrender!”. Sales are likely to be brisk given the enthusiasm with which the former president’s supporters now treat each public humiliation as an accomplishment.
Trump claims he did nothing wrong after surrender in Georgia election case – video
Two impeachments and four sets of indictments, from financial fraud to a slew of charges over the 2020 election, have done little to damage Trump’s standing among the true believers, and have only bolstered his run for the Republican presidential nomination. Such is the strength of that belief that a recent CBS poll showed Trump voters trust him more than their own family members and religious leaders.
Ordinary Americans have already got creative in response to the flood of indictments by mocking up pictures of the former president in an orange jump suit a la Guantánamo prison and in printing T-shirts with Trump in various states of detention with slogans declaring “Trumped up charges”, “Guilty AF”, “Guilty of winning” and “Legend”.
There will be plenty who will challenge Don Jr’s claim that the mugshot has instantly become the most iconic photo in US political history. Pictures of John F Kennedy’s assassination or Martin Luther King Jr leading the march for freedom or a host of other historic moments will surely prove more enduring.
But as with the gangsters and rock stars, Trump’s booking photo may come to define an era – one of unusual political turmoil that has yet to resolve whether his next mugshot is as an inmate.",5,1

The Eltham Hotel in the Northern Rivers of NSW is the quintessential Aussie country pub. Cold beer. Meat raffles. Ancient verandahs. Good dogs. How great are country pubs? Especially those which boost a community through top-notch food sourced locally (rather than deep-fried imported squid, say), cater to multiple generations and accommodate tourists. Like their city cousins, regional pubs are also changing. While there are still plenty of beaut yellow-tiled public bars with a choice of two to three taps, young gun hoteliers are increasingly selling just as much craft beer and cocktails as Tooheys, and weâre all for the shift. (Word around Jugiong way is that the Sir George has even introduced linen napkins.) Here are 10 of NSWâs best old and new-breed boozers. Billinudgel Hotel They donât make them like the Nudge anymore. The self-described âlast of the good olâ country pubsâ is 20 minutes north of Byron Bay, but could be 100 years in the past. A place of faded photos, creaking floorboards, Chesterfield lounges and old logs fashioned into furniture. The beer garden can lift off with Anzac Day-level energy on the weekend. Best for: Tall tales and cold ones on the back deck.

SMH,18AM 25/08/23,One of Sydney’s best trophy homes was built and hardly anyone knew,https://www.smh.com.au/property/news/one-of-sydney-s-best-trophy-homes-was-built-and-hardly-anyone-knew-20230821-p5dy7v.html,7,"Sydney’s trophy home market is well populated by famous houses, but among the ranks of our most indulgent and expensive residences is one that few prestige aficionados and even high-end buyers’ agents even know exists.
Despite Otahki’s relative anonymity – fostered in part by its position on the Lane Cove River and behind a housekeeper’s house on the street – it is ranked by prestige market veteran agent Ken Jacobs as one of the top three contemporary residences in Sydney.
Otahki is officially a five-bedroom house set across a series of interconnected buildings with add-ons like a squash court, a couple of swimming pools and basement garaging for eight cars.
It is a big call by Jacobs given that among his previous listings is James Packer’s $70 million mansion in Vaucluse, La Mer, and John Symond’s Point Piper home that was withdrawn from sale despite receiving a $110 million offer.
Buyers will be able to make their own judgment in the coming week when Otahki is laid bare to anyone with a lazy $50 million or so to buy it.",32,1
SMH,18AM 25/08/23,Australia’s financial future in five graphs,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/australia-s-financial-future-in-five-graphs-20230823-p5dyy0.html,6,"Older Australians will be financially supported by a smaller proportion of working-age people. The old-age dependency ratio measures the proportion of people over the age of 65 relative to those aged between 15 and 65. It gives an insight into the actual number of taxpayers compared to those who will draw on tax-funded services such as health and aged care. As the report notes, Australia (like most Western nations) benefited from the large Baby Boomer generation, born between 1946 and the mid-1960s. Lots of workers, who didn’t make a huge call on the public purse, paid lots of tax. But the Boomers, who started retiring in the 2010s, now need increasingly expensive government-supplied services.
The old-age dependency ratio surged last decade into this one to 26.6 per 100 working-age people. It is expected to slow a little, but will start picking up again in the 2040s as Gen Xers begin leaving the workforce. By 2062-63, when Millennials start to retire, the old-age dependency rate will be at 38.8 per 100 working-age people. It will be up to Gen Zs to work out how to care for Millennials. Home ownership For the first time, an intergenerational report has touched on the issue of home ownership. And the results, as anyone under the age of 40 knows, are confronting.
As prices have gone up, and mortgages have grown, people take longer to own a home. As the graph shows, among people in their late 20s, the proportion of home owners has dropped by 17 percentage points since 1981. Starting to buy a home later increases the chances of taking a mortgage into retirement. For those unable to buy a home, it also means a longer period on the rental rollercoaster. The report makes clear that if this trend continues, the nation’s key financial support systems for older Australians will start to fray. “These trends present a fiscal risk to age pension spending in the future and may impact patterns of how superannuation is drawn down,” it warned. Climate change impact on worker productivity
The report finds climate change could wipe between $135 billion and $423 billion from labour productivity over the next 40 years. This is actually the value of our day-to-day work, and doesn’t include things like increased spending on natural disasters or reduced wheat crops. The graph shows the amount of work carried out by Australians that will drop as temperatures go up. The fewer ways the globe’s governments find to limit climate change, the bigger the hit to our ability to work. People who have to work outside – such as labourers or machine operators – will be worst affected. This year in southern parts of the United States, we’ve already seen this type of impact. Government spending per person
This year’s federal budget contains a mind-boggling $680 billion in spending. The intergenerational report tries to make that number a little more comprehensible, breaking it down into spending per person. In the just-completed financial year, the government spent $23,808 for every person in the country. By 2062-63, in inflation-adjusted dollars, it will have climbed to $40,162. Spending is running a little faster than expected in the past two intergenerational reports, but slower than former treasurer Peter Costello feared in his two reports, the first in the series.",31,1
SMH,18AM 25/08/23,‘I did nothing wrong’: Donald Trump arrested over Georgia 2020 election charges,https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/donald-trump-arrives-in-georgia-for-booking-on-2020-election-subversion-charges-20230825-p5dzc4.html,5,"The entire process lasted about 20 minutes before Trump left the jail to return to Atlanta Airport and then on to his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey. Before taking off, he told reporters that it was a sad day for America and a “travesty of justice”. “I did nothing wrong and everybody knows that,” he said. “They’re trying to interfere with an election. There’s never been anything like it in our country before. This is their way of campaigning.” Hours after his visit to the jail, Trump took to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.
“ELECTION INTERFERENCE,” he wrote, in an apparent reference to his legal woes. “NEVER SURRENDER!” It was Trump’s first use of the platform since being kicked off it in 2021 following the riot at the Capitol that he was seen encouraging. In an interview with axed Fox News host Tucker Carlson this week, which was designed to upstage the first Republican debate, Trump described the multiple indictments against him as “all trivia, all nonsense”. “Bullshit, it’s all bullshit,” he said.
His surrender comes after several of his 18 alleged co-conspirators also turned themselves in, including key members of his former legal team: Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis. Loading Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows was the latest to surrender for his alleged role in helping Trump to pressure Georgia officials to overturn Biden’s election victory. The remaining co-defendants had until midday on Friday (US time) to do the same. Outside the jail ahead of his arrest, dozens of supporters began gathering around the entrance of the facility awaiting his arrival.
One man was seated opposite the main entrance of the jail with a handmade sign saying “Lock Biden Up”; another carried a sign saying “Trump Won – Save America”. Others, such as Virginia Webb, from north-east Georgia, took a different view. Donald Trump’s motorcade arrives at Fulton County Jail. Credit: Reuters “It was almost a two-hour trip to come here, but I know how important it is,” she told this masthead, holding a sign saying, “Trump, go directly to jail”. “Trump lost this election, but he tried to rig it, so he would get free votes here in Georgia.
“Thankfully we have elected officials – including Republican elected officials who are not afraid to stand up and do the right thing for Georgia citizens.” Trump’s latest surrender, which was televised live on US cable networks, also threw the spotlight on the parlous state of the facility where he was to be booked. Virginia Webb of north-east Georgia outside the Fulton County Jail. Credit: Farrah Tomazin Conditions at the Fulton County Jail are so bad that the federal justice department last month launched an investigation into “credible allegations that an incarcerated person died covered in insects and filth”. The department raised concerns that the jail was “structurally unsafe, that prevalent violence has resulted in serious injuries and homicides, and that officers are being prosecuted for using excessive force.”
The jail is a few kilometres from the courthouse where Trump and 18 alleged co-conspirators were indicted by an Atlanta grand jury this month after a 2½-year investigation by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. The charges cover claims that Trump and his allies were part of a racketeering scheme that included setting up phoney electors to produce fake votes, making false representations to the courts, tampering with electronic voting machines, misusing the power of the Justice Department and pressuring state and federal officials not to certify Biden’s win. The best-known part of the alleged scheme involves the now-infamous phone call Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, urging him to “find” the 11,780 votes he needed to put him ahead of Biden. But 13 charges against Trump in Georgia are particularly troubling for the former president because he won’t have the power to pardon himself, should he be re-elected, as he otherwise could in a federal conviction.
The only option he would have would be to apply to Georgia’s State Board of Pardons and Paroles – and only after five years after serving his sentence. Loading The charges are also based on Georgia’s expansive Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations law – otherwise known as RICO – which is used to target mobsters involved in organised crime, such as money laundering, bribery, and drug trafficking. RICO carries a penalty of between five and 20 years in prison. Willis has suggested she is ready to go to trial immediately and has nominated October 23 as the start date for all 19 defendants in the case.",30,1

Key points: Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there are many facts yet to be established
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there are many facts yet to be established An investigation into the crash is ongoing and no cause has been given
An investigation into the crash is ongoing and no cause has been given None of the bodies have been identified
President Vladimir Putin on Thursday sent his condolences to Mr Prigozhin's family, breaking his silence after the mercenary leader's plane crashed on Wednesday evening with no survivors two months after he led a mutiny against army chiefs.
Mr Putin cited ""preliminary information"" as indicating that Mr Prigozhin and his top associates in the Wagner mercenary group had been killed.
Russian investigators have opened a probe into what happened, but have not yet said what they suspect caused the plane to suddenly fall from the sky north-west of Moscow.
Nor have they officially confirmed the identities of the 10 bodies recovered from the wreckage.
Western politicians and commentators have suggested that Mr Putin ordered Mr Prigozhin killed to punish him for launching a failed June 23-34 mutiny against the top brass which represented the biggest challenge to the president's rule yet.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the accusation and many others like it were false.
""There is now a great deal of speculation surrounding this plane crash and the tragic deaths of the plane's passengers, including Yevgeny Prigozhin. Of course, in the West, all this speculation is presented from a well-known angle,"" Mr Peskov told reporters.
""All of this is an absolute lie, and here, when covering this issue, it is necessary to base yourself on facts. There are not many facts yet. They need to be established in the course of investigative actions.""
Mr Peskov said that it was important to wait for the results of various tests as well as the outcome of the investigation.
He said Mr Putin had not met Mr Prigozhin recently.
Lukashenko says Prigozhin dismissed his warnings
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said warned Mr Prigozhin and his fellow Wagner leader Dmitry Utkin to watch out for possible threats to their lives, according to reports by state news agency BELTA.
Mr Lukashenko claimed he insisted that Wagner fighters would remain in Belarus.

Twice Mr Prigozhin dismissed concerns raised by the Belarusian leader about possible threats to his life, Mr Lukashenko said.
Mr Lukashenko said that during the June mutiny, he warned Mr Prigozhin that he would die if he continued to march on Moscow, to which he said Mr Prigozhin answered: ""To hell with it — I will die.""
He also claimed when Mr Prigozhin and Mr Utkin, had come to see him, he had warned them both: ""Lads — you watch out.""
It was not clear when that conversation took place.
Mr Lukashenko, both an old acquaintance of Mr Prigozhin and a close ally of Russia, said Mr Putin had nothing to do with the plane crash.
""I know Putin: he is calculating, very calm, even tardy,"" Mr Lukashenko said.
""I cannot imagine that Putin did it, that Putin is to blame. It's just too rough and unprofessional a job.""
Mr Lukashenko said Wagner fighters would remain in Belarus.
""Wager lived, Wagner is living and Wagner will live in Belarus,"" Mr Lukashenko said. ""The core remains here.""
""As long as we need this unit, they will live and work with us,"" he said.

SMH,18AM 25/08/23,AEC ticks off Peter Dutton over ‘factually incorrect’ complaint,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/aec-ticks-off-peter-dutton-over-factually-incorrect-complaint-20230825-p5dzga.html,4,"“The AEC completely and utterly rejects the suggestions by some that by transparently following the established, public and known legislative requirements we are undermining the impartiality and fairness of the referendum.” The opposition’s legal affairs spokeswoman Michaelia Cash, however, hit back at the AEC statement and said allowing people to put a cross to denote a No vote was a “basic question of fairness”. “If a tick counts for Yes, a cross should count for No. To do otherwise gives the Yes case an unfair advantage. The decision to treat ticks as ‘yes’ but crosses as ambiguous is a decision the AEC has made,” she said. “Saying that there’s a savings provision is misleading. There is no savings provision that deals with ticks and crosses. The AEC says this approach is based on legal advice from the 1980s. But the Australian people have never seen that advice – and just because you’ve done something for a long time doesn’t mean it’s right.”
“The sensible thing would be to make a clear rule so that ticks and crosses are treated equally, and neither side gets an advantage.” Loading The AEC was asked for a copy of the legal advice. In an interview with this masthead earlier this month, Rogers said some of the theories the AEC had seen online about the referendum being compromised were “truly nutty, tinfoil hat-wearing, bonkers conspiracy theories”. “That doesn’t mean people can’t express those views but if they’re talking about the electoral system and trying to confuse people, it’s our job to fix it.”
The AEC has launched a campaign called stop and consider, Rogers said, to encourage people to think about the reliability of sources they accessed for election information. Loading ABC election analyst Antony Green suggested the No campaign may have raised concerns about crosses now to make the case that “the Yes case is getting all the advantages, with institutions all signed on” in support. “This could have been raised earlier this year when the Referendum Act was reviewed, but no one raised this as an issue,” he said. “The rules on what is called the ‘savings provision’, the Act says write Yes or No but the provision for formality gives leeway so that a vote with a clear intent to say Yes or No can count. So if someone writes ‘yeah’ or ‘hell no’ or ‘yessss’ or ‘no way’, that is not Yes or No but the intent is clear and it is counted.
“But when it comes to ticks and crosses there is a body of case law on the subject which rules on what the meaning of a tick and what the meaning of a cross is and it’s not all related to elections either. The AEC has solicitor-general’s advice on this. This looks perfectly sound to me.” Despite Dutton’s insistence that an X should denote a No vote, in his 2022 election candidate nomination form he repeatedly placed an X in a box to indicate a Yes to questions about his citizenship and the country of his parents’ birth, for example. A screenshot from Peter Dutton’s Registry of Members’ Interests showing he used a cross to select Yes. Australian National University politics lecturer Jill Sheppard said the AEC had to deal with one of the world’s most complicated electoral systems because of compulsory voting and the preferential voting system. “It is not an exaggeration to say they are really world-leading in election administration and we don’t give them enough credit. They export their knowledge around the world and particularly throughout Asia,” she said.
“In as much as this helps the No campaign, Peter Dutton knows what he is doing. He is pushing a narrative around complexity.” The AEC noted in the 1999 referendum, just 0.86 per cent of votes cast were informal and of those informal votes, only a few related to people using either a tick or a cross rather than writing Yes or No on their ballot paper. Indigenous Australians Minister Linda Burney said the AEC was a trusted entity in this country and the way that they are conducting this referendum is absolutely no different to previous national votes. “The important thing is that Australians know their way around ballot papers. And this is a referendum that requires Australian people to write either ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ in the space provided. And my encouragement is to write ‘Yes’,” she said.",29,1

All that leads to is less development, and the development that does happen is generally done by the groups who have the means to sit around and wait.”
The NSW government has produced a discussion paper on liquor licensing reform, which went on public exhibition last year and has been under review since. The paper acknowledged current processes could be fragmented, duplicative and time-consuming, and proposed a new model that would require just one joint DA and liquor licence application. It would flow through the approval pathways of Liquor and Gaming and the relevant council, who would talk to each other.

However, the paper says this is a “longer-term aspiration”, beyond five years, as it would require “significant technological, legislative, and administrative changes in multiple portfolio areas and levels of government, and with flow-on effects for all aspects of the planning and liquor licensing systems”.
Music and Night-time Economy Minister John Graham acknowledged the current system is too complicated for both the government and bar owners, “and that’s the culture we’d like to change”. He said the five-year-plus timeframe for reform proposed by the department was “too long”.",28,1

The current pain might feel like an acute moment, but it is really the culmination of decades of policy in which every factor has pulled in the direction of making housing unaffordable. Our tax system encourages us to take on large amounts of debt to accumulate investment properties, while we build houses too slowly to meet demand.
We’re about to get older – which means we require much more government spending on things like healthcare, aged care and the NDIS – and have no real way to pay for it. Even old favourites such as taxing petrol or cigarettes will fall short because electric cars are only going to get more popular, and tobacco tax revenue has already started falling.
Economists use such boring language, don’t they? Take the following from this week’s Intergenerational Report : “Structural changes to the economy are projected to put pressure on the revenue base over the coming decades”. That’s an extremely dull way of saying we have a massive tax problem.
Meanwhile, we seek more workers to fund expanding government spending. That’s hard in an ageing society where an ever smaller proportion of people work and pay tax. Hence, the imperative for us to have more babies, take in migrants or both. Accordingly, the housing crisis is not an adjunct to our tax problem: it’s at the core of it. People who can’t afford housing aren’t likely to rush into having kids. And adding migrants rapidly adds demand for housing, thereby making it immediately more expensive.
A major problem here is that we rely far too much on collecting tax from workers. They pay twice as much overall tax as companies, for example, and enjoy relatively few tax breaks. At the same time, we give tax breaks to people who own investment properties and increase the demand for houses. You don’t have to believe property owners are all fat cats to think this is a problem. Indeed, many landlords are not particularly wealthy. But the issue here isn’t one of wealth so much as it is one of incentives. When we direct our tax concessions to property owners rather than workers, we make two significant, related statements: 1) having assets is better than working; and 2) passive income is better than income from productive activity.
Loading
We’re used to talking about productivity when it comes to workers. Specifically, we hear that wage growth without a corresponding increase in productivity simply leads to inflation, and because Australia has a productivity problem at the moment, real wage growth is unrealistic. Why, then, doesn’t a similar idea apply to property investment? We encourage it, and our politics therefore requires property prices to keep increasing, but we never talk about whether this is productive. And in truth, there’s often very little that’s productive about it.
If I buy a house, then rent it out and wait for its value to increase over time, what will I have actually produced? The house exists either way, someone lives in it either way, and it requires no real labour from me. Unless I’m ploughing significant money into renovation, maintenance is about the most productive thing I could say I’m doing.",27,1

SBS,05AM 26/08/23,Sound of Freedom: An anti-trafficking movie endorsed by QAnon has just landed in Australia,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/the-feed/article/qanon-kidnapping-charges-and-overhyped-ticket-sales-the-sound-of-freedom-movie-cant-escape-controversy/t15hym935,11,"The action-thriller Sound of Freedom has now been released in Australian cinemas - but its arrival is riddled with baggage.
It was a sleeper hit, initially overshadowed by Barbie and Oppenheimer when it was first released last month. Now, it's one of the highest-grossing movies released in the US this year.
Jim Caviezel (who played Jesus in Mel Gibson's movie The Passion of the Christ), stars as Tim Ballard, the real-life Homeland Security Agent who creates a charity to combat child traffickers.
But for many reasons, separate from the heavy subject matter at the focus of the film, the movie is leaving people uncomfortable.
And now it's available across cinemas in Australia - with Dendy cinemas (co-owned by Mel Gibson) also screening the movie, citing “overwhelming demand”. In a tweet promoting the movie, the film's distributors said, ""Break the Silence. Save The Children,"" a popular phrase coined by QAnon.
The first controversy: The QAnon support
The movie was shot in 2018, at a time when the American conspiracy theory movement, QAnon, was starting to gain traction.
And its script was written in 2015, well before the movement's emergence in 2017, its writer and director Alejandro Monteverde told entertainment news publication Variety.
While the film, made by Angel Studios, tells a non-partisan story and doesn't reference QAnon, believers of the conspiracy theory have latched onto the film, promoting it for their own agenda.
QAnon followers believe that left-leaning elites in government, Hollywood stars and billionaires run a paedophile and human trafficking ring. They also believe that these people are harvesting an adrenaline-like substance from children to attain eternal life. Former US President Donald Trump is also thought by followers to be waging a secret battle against this “deep state” scheme.
It hasn't helped that lead actor Caviezel has repeated several QAnon phrases on conservative talk shows like ""andrenochroming,"" the false term used to describe the extraction of a substance from child victims to harvest the elixir of youth. He has also used other language of the movement (""a big storm is coming"") and in 2021, attended a QAnon-adjacent conference.
Aside from QAnon believers, the movie is being championed by other notable conservative figures like Trump, who hosted a viewing party at his golf course with Caviezel and the agent who inspired his role in attendance.
Monteverde, who did not attend, said the political ties from others were hurting his film, and he prefers to keep his distance.
The second controversy: Misleading portrayals of child trafficking
In Sound of Freedom, Caviezel as Ballard takes on a crime syndicate in Colombia after children are snatched by strangers.
This depiction has stoked concern from human and child trafficking experts who say while people can be kidnapped by strangers and trafficked, it's not the typical way it's done.
READ MORE My daughter was taken by a sex trafficker and now has a price tag on her
Typically, it's done by someone who knows the person and exploits that trust. Now, experts are concerned the hype around this film could actually do more harm than good and prevent people from spotting the most common - actually foreseeable - warning signs.
Elizabeth Campbell, co-director of the University of Michigan's Human Trafficking Clinic, told NPR: ""By doing that, I think we make actual victims of human trafficking more invisible and more vulnerable to exploitation.""
World's Children, a charity supporting vulnerable children, says poor families with financial struggles and debt, and kids who have run away or are homeless are most at risk of being trafficked.
The third controversy: One of the donors was charged with child kidnapping
Explaining this one requires some context.
The Sound of Freedom was independently filmed in 2018, on a budget of about $14.5m ($22.1m), but was delayed when its distributor, 21st Century Fox, was bought by Disney in 2019.
The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the delay, and then in 2023, distribution rights were acquired by Angel Studios.
Child-trafficking experts are saying the anti-trafficking film could do more harm than good. Credit: Angel Studios Angel Studios is a self-described values-based company, though others call it faith-based, as it is behind a number of Christian movies and shows. Before distributing original content, Angel Studios made its brand by removing nudity, swearing and violence from mainstream movies and shows before it was sued by a number of well-known Hollywood studios for copyright.
To raise the $5m ($7.8m) the company needed to distribute and market the film, it crowdfunded the money from ""angel"" investors.
One of the film's many investors, Fabian Marta, was arrested on 23 July and charged as an accessory for child kidnapping in the US state of Missouri, NewsWeek reported. While the details of the case are not public, this charge carries a penalty of 10 to 30 years in prison or life imprisonment.
The fourth controversy: The Pay-It-Forward sales are misleading
It's true the film has been unexpectedly popular, grossing more than the latest Mission: Impossible and Indiana Jones movies in the US.
But some of these sales are being called into question.
In the film's closing credits, the hero of the film, Caviezel, asks viewers to “ pay it forward ” by buying someone else a ticket. It's unclear how many of those tickets actually translated into actual views, but people online have noticed that the theatres have sometimes been more vacant than online seat availability suggests.
On the Angel Studios site, under the heading, ""How can I join the fight to end child trafficking?"" the creators say, ""Seeing the film is the first step in spreading awareness about child trafficking,"" before suggesting to pay it forward or claim a free ticket.
Paying it forward will help you ""join a historical movement to promote stories that amplify light,"" it writes.
In the last paragraph, there is a link giving viewers a different resource (other than paying it forward).",24,1
SBS,05AM 26/08/23,"Tax changes, 'major disruptions', and an ageing Australia: Our future unpacked",https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/intergenerational-report-predicts-tax-changes-major-disruptions/h2minvvu4,10,"KEY POINTS: The Intergenerational Report has been released, giving a picture of Australia in 40 years.
Australia's population will be much older and more heavily dependent on aged care.
The IGR has also laid bare the impact climate change could have on future generations.
Australians have been given the clearest snapshot of what their country will look like four decades from now.
The sixth Intergenerational Report (IGR), released two years after the last one, warns of how an ageing population and sliding birth rate will hit the economy in 2063.
It also gives insight into climate change's devastating impact on the economy, why your taxes may need to change, and how our increasingly volatile region could alter the way we trade.
""These forces will influence the future path and structure of our economy and change how Australians live, work, and engage with the world,"" it says.
Here are the key takeaways.
Climate change to rock the economy
The impact of climate change is a key feature of this year's IGR, and it's grim reading.
""Floods, bushfires and other extreme weather events are expected to increase in frequency and severity, causing major disruptions to local economic activity and ultimately hindering overall economic output,"" it says.
The report outlines four key areas that will be particularly impacted by 2063 if temperatures rise above two degrees:
Productivity
Agriculture
Tourism
Natural disaster spending
The impact of higher temperatures could wipe away between $135 billion and $423 billion in productivity over the next four decades, it says.
Higher temperatures will force international tourists to adjust where they travel, and the report predicts the impact will be twice as bad if temperatures rise by three degrees instead of two.
The government could be spending three times as much responding to natural disasters, the report says. Source: AAP / Sean Davey And it warns that increasingly frequent bushfires, floods and cyclones will also force tourists to cancel, or simply not book, trips to Australia. It also expects the government will need to spend triple what it does now responding to natural disasters.
Farmers are also set for punishment. The IGR expects crop yields to fall by up to 4 per cent, and that's before changes to rainfall patterns are taken into account.
Worse still, the report warns climate change's ""indirect and cumulative"" consequences are likely to exacerbate these challenges.
Global efforts to move away from fossil fuels will upend Australia's resources sector.
If temperature rises are capped at 1.5 per cent, the IGR expects international demand for Australian coal in 2063 to be just 1 per cent of current levels. But it tips other critical minerals to become increasingly profitable, with global demand for lithium to increase eight-fold.
A bigger, older population
Australia is going to get much bigger, and much older.
That will mean big economic challenges.
There'll be an extra 14 million people in the country by 2063, with the population to grow past 40 million. But it's worth noting previous IGRs have underestimated population growth.
Treasurer Jim Chalmers speaks to the media during a press conference. Source: AAP / Bianca De Marchi This year's prediction is partially based on a rise in life expectancy - from 81 to 87 for men, and from 85 to 89 for women - resulting from better health treatment.
That will pose challenges for older Australians, and potentially impact their standard of living.
""Longevity risk - the risk of outliving savings – is a key concern for retirees in deciding how to draw down their superannuation,"" the report says.
And younger Australians are having fewer children, which will also skew age demographics.
The number of people over 65 is going to more than double by 2063, and the number of people over 85 is going to more than triple.
That means the economy will need to change drastically.
We'll become much more reliant on a rapidly expanded care sector, which includes things such as health and aged care. While the sector currently accounts for around 8 per cent of GDP, the report predicts it'll be around 15 per cent by 2063.
""Part of this demand may be met by data and digital technologies increasing productivity and enabling more Australians to participate in work,"" the report says.
Australia's older population will make it increasingly reliant on aged care. Source: Getty / Maskot
Economy to slow, some costs to blow out
Like other countries in the OECD (a group of 38 countries with advanced economies), economic growth is also expected to slow, largely as a result of the above.
And spending in certain key areas - aged care, the NDIS, health, defence, and interest on the nation's debt - is set to balloon.
Those five currently account for around a third of government spending, but that's set to rise to roughly half.
Workers carrying more of tax burden
Regular workers are set to pick up a greater chunk of the tax burden over the next decade.
That's because the budget will come to more heavily rely on personal income tax, with GST and company tax set to remain stable.
A proportionately smaller pool of working-age Australians, supporting a higher proportion of retirees needing health and aged care, will put extra pressure on the budget.
There'll also be a longer-term shift in where government can source its money.
Labor has long encouraged Australians to buy electric vehicles, and the shift away from regular cars is expected to accelerate this decade partly due to tax incentives. But fewer petrol cars means the government recouping less from taxes on petrol.
There's also been a consistent decline in the number of young Australians taking up smoking. If that trend continues, that again means less revenue from taxing cigarettes. That was worth about $14 billion in 2020-21.
Geopolitical risks to increase
Increasing tensions in our region will pose challenges for decades.
While the COVID-19 pandemic laid bare weaknesses in the global supply chains, the IGR also notes that trade and investment have increasingly been used as ""tools of statecraft"".
Australia has certainly borne the brunt of that, after a series of trade sanctions imposed on its exports by China.
The report says that dynamic is likely to deepen, something that will require ""unprecedented"" coordination between Australia's domestic policy, foreign policy, and national security arms.
And a hot war in the Indo-Pacific would have ""far-reaching consequences"" for our economy, it warns.",23,1

Opposition Leader Peter Dutton says voters should be able to validly use a tick or cross on their ballot paper for the Indigenous Voice referendum, accusing the Yes camp of attempting to ""skew"" the vote.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will announce the date of the referendum in Adelaide midway through next week.

Dutton said he was open to supporting government legislation to clarify the issue ahead of the referendum, which is expected on 14 October.
Voters to write Yes or No on ballot
The AEC said the formal voting instructions for the referendum are to clearly write Yes or No in full and in English.
The commission expects the instructions to be followed, as they were in 1999 when the informal vote rate was 0.86 per cent.
The AEC has long-standing legal advice about ticks and crosses.
As well, ""savings provisions"" give the commission the ability to count a vote where the instructions have not been followed but the voter's intention is clear.
A number of government and business forms allow a cross or ""check mark"" to be used to indicate a positive decision, leaving it open to interpretation or challenge by a polling booth scrutineer.
A tick may also be open to interpretation and may not count, depending on just how clear that mark is on the ballot paper, as would a Y or an N written in the box.
Scrutineers will be present through the count on referendum day to observe the process.

SBS,05AM 26/08/23,What Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin's death could mean for the war in Ukraine,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/what-the-wagner-chiefs-death-could-mean-for-the-war-in-ukraine/erzfp72i3,7,"Perhaps the most unexpected thing about the plane crash that reportedly killed Yevgeny Prigozhin , the bombastic head of Russia’s infamous Wagner group, is that it happened a full two months after he brought Russia to what President Vladimir Putin warned at the time was the brink of civil war.
Prigozhin certainly seemed to be living on borrowed time. His bizarre revolt against Russia’s military leadership, which saw an armoured Wagner convoy proceed largely unchallenged through southern Russia until it stopped just short of Moscow, flew in the face of the twin rules for survival in Putin’s Russia.
One, you don’t rock the boat. Two, you don’t challenge the tsar.
But the popular assumption that Prigozhin would swiftly be eliminated – which shifted to surprise when he wasn’t – tells us much about the current weakness and fragility that surrounds Russian politics.
In fact, Prigozhin’s apparent elimination is likely to exacerbate that weakness rather than lead to a magical reassertion of Putin’s authority .
READ MORE What role did Wagner play in the election of Donald Trump?
First, it shows Russian elites they can’t trust anything their president says. That’s a significant departure from the Kremlin’s previous modus operandi, whereby those in positions of power and influence were protected by Putin. They could count on him as long as they played by his rules.
Although Prigozhin eventually departed from that, he went out of his way for many years – even after his mutiny – to demonstrate his loyalty to Putin.
READ MORE The mysterious deaths of Vladimir Putin’s enemies and critics
Following the Wagner revolt, it seemed perplexing for Putin to give Prigozhin and his Wagner co-conspirators a public assurance they would be safe from retribution.
Now, Prigozhin’s subsequent likely death – the crash was reported by Wagner’s Telegram channel as having been caused by a Russian air defence missile – means it matters very little whether it was an accident: nobody will believe this was anything other than revenge.
While that may initially give the more ambitious members of the Kremlin clans some pause, they now have real incentives to seek out an alternative.
Put simply, Putin’s politics of terror has a self-destructive flaw: ruling through fear and deception inevitably prompts those who might be targets (which is essentially anyone) to eventually try to change the rules of the game.
Second, Prigozhin’s death won’t spell the end for private military companies (PMCs) in Russia. On the contrary, they’re likely to continue to proliferate. Already the energy giant Gazprom has several of them, with operators in Ukraine as well as Russia.
There is also speculation the fast-expanding Redut group may now try to step in to fill the Wagner void.
READ MORE What were Yevgeny Prigozhin and his Wagner mercenaries doing in Africa?
But this has a bearing on Russian domestic politics too: PMCs are likely to be used by influential figures as private armies for their own protection from the Russian state, just as much as they might be employed as proxies in its service.
That, in turn, raises the spectre of a society of warlords – not just confined to strongmen on Russia’s periphery, such as the Kadyrovites who are loyal to Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov – but in other parts of Russia closer to the centres of power in Moscow and St Petersburg. Under those circumstances, the prospects for stability in Russia are grim.
Ironically, perhaps the least significant impact of Prigozhin’s death will be on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Wagner forces had been withdrawn from combat a couple of months previously. They have not been redeployed to the front since Prigozhin’s revolt.
Wagner troops have been offered the choice of joining other Russian PMCs or signing contracts with the Russian armed forces: the former remains the preferred option given the regular Russian military is poorly paid in comparison. There will also be those who choose neither option, leaving the problem of significant numbers of Russian men trained for violence at large in its society.
As for the future of the organisation itself, Wagner is at a crossroads. In addition to Prigozhin, two other victims in the crash were Wagner’s alleged co-founder Dmitry Utkin, who was responsible for its combat operations, and its head of security Valery Chekalov.
The crash has therefore not only killed a Putin rival but also permanently erased Wagner’s senior command structure.
Yet Wagner remains important for the promotion of the Kremlin’s interests in damaging US and European influence in Africa.
Beyond its active role in Syria, it has been instrumental in boosting Russian prestige by propping up regional dictators in Mali and the Central African Republic, which have rewarded Wagner with lucrative natural resource contracts.
It may continue in an abridged form under new management, or be subsumed into another proxy Russian force.
READ MORE There are fears Russia's Wagner mercenaries are taking advantage of instability in Niger
A final important puzzle concerns why the Kremlin waited so long to rid itself of Prigozhin. We can only speculate here, but one theory is the intelligence services needed time to discover how deeply the pro-Wagner rot had extended into the armed forces and other power structures.
It is striking that Sergei Surovikin (the former commander of Russian forces in Ukraine who had disappeared under suspicion of being a Wagner sympathiser) was formally removed from his post as Russia’s Air Force chief at almost the exact same time as Prigozhin’s plane went down.
Prigozhin’s career trajectory saw him rise from a convicted felon to presidential caterer, then Russia’s main disinformation peddler, and eventually the wealthy and brutal head of a semi-private military company that sought to outcompete Russia’s own Defence Ministry for influence.",20,1

Ben Roberts-Smith's civil proceedings against Nine Entertainment were dismissed earlier this year The AFP and the Office of the Special Investigator want access to sensitive parts of the court file
The AFP and the Office of the Special Investigator want access to sensitive parts of the court file A court was told an investigation into alleged criminal offences in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016 is underway
The war veteran's civil proceedings against Nine Entertainment were dismissed earlier this year, after Justice Anthony Besanko ruled there was substantial truth to allegations of war crimes and bullying.
Parts of the trial were heard in closed court and many former and current SAS soldiers gave evidence under pseudonyms.
The Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Office of the Special Investigator (OSI) now want access to sensitive parts of the court file.
However, Mr Roberts-Smith's lawyers argued Justice Besanko should disqualify himself from making that decision due to apprehended bias.
A written judgement on that question, published on Friday, refers to material from OSI Director of Investigations, Ross Barnett.
He told the court the AFP and OSI are looking into alleged criminal offences under Australian law, arising from or related to breaches of the Law of Armed Conflict, by members of the ADF in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016.
The investigations are known as Operation Emerald, which according to Mr Barnett ""currently consists of approximately 40 investigations, and that although all of these investigations are active, the level of investigative focus varies across the investigations from time to time"".
""Mr Barnett deposes that his ability to disclose the details of the investigations in an open and unclassified affidavit is limited,"" the judgement said.
""But that he is able to say that there is an overlap between the subject matter of the investigations and the subject matter of the defamation proceedings"".
""Criminal offences of the kind being investigated are extremely grave and their thorough investigation is of national and international importance.""
The Commonwealth wants access to information including a list of witness pseudonyms in the defamation trial, closed court transcripts, sensitive outlines of evidence and documents tendered in closed court.
Mr Roberts-Smith's lawyers' suggestion of apprehended bias — as opposed to actual bias — related to Justice Besanko's findings in the defamation case.
The judge on Friday said he had made ""a number of serious findings of fact and credit"" against Mr Roberts-Smith.
The veteran's lawyers argued a ""reasonable observer"" may perceive a connection between the court's findings and the court being called upon to take steps which ""undermine"" the presumption of innocence.
Noting the circumstances were ""unusual"", Justice Besanko concluded that a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that he ""might not bring an impartial mind"" to the Commonwealth's requests.
The applications will be referred to another judge.
Mr Roberts-Smith is launching an appeal after his loss in the defamation case, which is expected to take place in February.",2,1

CEO Alan Joyce celebrated the fact consumers were willing to spend more on travel ""despite cost-of-living pressures"".
The federal treasurer says Qantas shouldn't have to pay back the taxpayer money it received during the pandemic.
Treasurer Jim Chalmers has rejected suggestions Qantas should pay back the money it received from the government after the airline posted record profits.
On Thursday, Qantas reported an underlying profit of $2.47 billion for the past financial year, compared with an almost $2 billion loss the year before.
But the Flying Kangaroo is under pressure in the wake of the results to pay back money it received from the federal government at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
It received $2.7 billion from taxpayers during the pandemic, including $900 million from the JobKeeper program.
The profit report came as Qantas and its chief executive Alan Joyce (pictured) face fierce criticism over alleged price-gouging, customer refunds and government bailouts. Source: AAP The airline's chief executive Alan Joyce said it was just 11 weeks away from bankruptcy at the time.
But Chalmers said the profits from Qantas showed the tourism industry was making a strong recovery post-COVID.
""When those funds were provided by the previous government, there wasn't an understanding or an agreement that they would be repaid in some form,"" he told ABC Radio on Friday.
""What (the profits) reflect is the fact the Australian tourism industry is making a big contribution to our economy and that's a good thing.
""It's a big employer in our economy.""
Joyce said the JobKeeper funds from the government went to its employees.
""As we're making money, we'll pay corporation tax and getting there faster,"" he told the ABC's 7.30 program.
""Should our people who got the money for JobKeeper pay that back?
""I'd say no because that's asking them to pay it back in a difficult period of time, so what money do we pay back exactly?""
Joyce, who has been summoned to appear before the Australian Senate's cost-of-living inquiry next week, said economy fares had dropped 12 per cent since peaking last December.
Opposition leader Peter Dutton said Joyce had led the airline well during a difficult period, which included the pandemic.
""It was a tough period for those airlines, to be able to keep the company afloat during that period with the support of a lot of taxpayers money, I think that will be one thing that (Mr Joyce) chalks up,"" he told Nine's Today program.
What fuelled Qantas' record profits?
The profits for the 2022-23 financial year were fuelled by falling jet fuel prices, high travel demand and high airfares. They also contrast with the airline’s $1.86 billion loss the previous year, following a COVID-induced slowdown of travel.
Joyce described the result as a ""remarkable turnaround"".
“Fundamentally, travel demand is extremely robust … Despite cost-of-living pressures, survey data shows people are planning to spend more on travel over the next six months and less on homewares, renovations and even alcohol.”
READ MORE Airfare prices have soared to new heights, and they could rise even further
Off the back of such positive results, Qantas said it would return another $500 million to shareholders and issue all staff $500 worth of travel credit.
The profits came in a year in which airfares soared.
A June report from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) revealed the average return price for economy-class international airfares from Australia had increased by more than 50 per cent compared to pre-COVID levels - soaring to $1,827 from a 2019 average of $1,213 - despite the price of jet fuel almost halving over the previous 12 months.
It also noted the ways in which the duopoly between Qantas (which also owns Jetstar) and Virgin Australia was contributing to high prices.
An ACCC report said Qantas and Virgin had benefited from a lack of competition in the domestic aviation sector. Source: AAP / Con Chronis In May, upon learning of forecasts that Qantas would record underlying profits around the $2.5 billion mark, the Transport Workers Union (TWU) called on the airline to pay back the government support it received during the pandemic – a period during which it also laid off thousands of staff.
""This obscene profit forecast is the result of Qantas management bleeding dry workers, passengers and the tax-paying public,” TWU national secretary Michael Kaine said at the time.
Qantas is also facing a class action lawsuit over its refund policy for flights cancelled due to the pandemic, which resulted in customers being allocated travel credits instead of cash refunds.
Lawyers in the class action allege that this allowed the airline to treat its customers’ money as more than “$1bn in interest-free loans,” and accuse the company of being “unjustly enriched by holding a very significant quantum of customer funds that it ought to have refunded”.",18,1

After Europe, South America and Australia, he will walk back home via India.
He cooks and sleeps in the wild, asks for water from passersby, washes his clothes in houses of strangers.
Nicolò Guarrera, aka ‘Pieroad’ (pìe is Venetian for foot), is a man on a mission.
Right now, he is walking from Alice Springs to Darwin, a distance of nearly 3,000km.
But his plan is bigger, much bigger: he is travelling the world on foot.
However, he isn't campaigning for any cause. The walk is the cause.
The 27-year-old has already walked through Europe and South America and will enter Asia from Darwin where he reached via Adelaide — the two far ends of Australia.
By the time you read this, he would have walked through three continents and ready for the fourth, covering approximately 35,000km.
That makes four years of constant walking.
Wait, what? Let’s contextualise.
It was May 2020, and the world was facing the COVID-19 pandemic.
Nicolò, a 27-year-old man from Malo, a little Veneto village on the outskirts of Vicenza in Italy, worked for a chocolate brand as a category planner.
One day, he left everything behind and began a world tour on foot.
I thought that if beauty will save the world, as they say, who will save beauty? So, I decided to store as much beauty as possible, and because I always loved walking, I started planning this journey. Nicolò Guarrera
Let’s put this into numbers.
For everyone who aims for the canonical 10,000 steps a day for their fitness, Nicolò will clock – considering an average of 1,350 steps per km – over 47 million steps by the end of his journey.
Nicolò is planning to end his journey in mid-2025, when he says, ""I will walk back to my couch, at home.""
That stacks up to 4,725 days or 13 years of walking.
Find a friend, find a treasure

With every step he takes, his friend Ezio accompanies him.
Ezio is not a fellow Italian walker, but a trolley in which Nicolò carries everything he needs to survive the trudge.
Ezio is the best companion. He helps immensely, he does not talk, and he listens. What more can you want?
As with his job, he had to deal with logistics and problem-solving in this pursuit too, for which Nicolò says he adopted a very rational approach to the crucial phase of trip planning.
He says he saved as much money as possible while planning the finest details of the trip like his itinerary, resting areas, food and other supplies.
Then some sponsors followed, providing him with necessities such as shoes.
“I have already gone through 14 pairs,"" he laughs.
Somewhere between the earth and the sky is a stream of thoughts. Credit: Instagram/Pieroad__ Nicolò built his image through his walk, and sponsors began to walk with him.
""I don't ask for money, I just want shoes or equipment. I have noticed that all my sponsors immediately felt empathetic towards my story, and they accepted to be a part of it,"" he says.
In the first two-and-a-half years, Nicolò crossed the border with France, then Spain.
The second continent on his list was South America.
Everything he does has “a strong rationale and follows a strict plan,” he says.
I need to walk at least 30km a day, and no more than 50km because my body needs sufficient rest. And guess what? I can eat lots of fatty food; it serves my purpose.

The Italian walker is attracting supporters and social media followers day after day.
At the time writing this story, Nicolò, or Pieroad, had more than 22,000 followers on Instagram and almost 35,000 on TikTok.
Pieroad also has website , where supporters can track Nicolò realtime and support him financially.
Nicolò Guarrera prepares for the road ahead. Credit: Instagram/Pieroad__ How does he survive?
His walks take him to remote places where he can go without a basic necessity of modern-day life for days on end: the internet.
Nicolò has his mobile phone, but he doesn't mind being disconnected for a few days.
It is a digital fasting that helps me detox, so I do not try to be connected all the time at all places.
""When I have connectivity, I get in touch with my dear ones and update my social media,"" he adds.
His daily routine is rigid and strategic.
""I wake up early, at around 6am and try to complete nearly 60 per cent of my daily target of 30-50 km in the morning,"" Nicolò says.

Setting up the tent, cooking some dinner, reading a book, writing some notes and absorbing his daily intake of thoughts, possibly admiring a starry nightsky, are the key-points of his afternoons and nights.
""Unless I am with someone, in that case, I chat, chat, chat,"" Nicolò says.
Under the Southern Cross. Credit: Instagram/Pieroad__ To plan his diet, Nicolò needs to consider the limitations of space and time.
He can’t store too much in Ezio and needs food that lasts at least four or five days.
“This means lots of protein and chocolate, which gives me immediate energy. When I reach a village or town, I can eat everything I want, mainly chips,” he says.
In Australia, “as the post works very well”, Nicolò prepared many small boxes while he was in Adelaide and posted them to the post offices he was meant to cross on his way across the length of the continent.
""It always feels like finding a $50 note in an old pair of trousers, I always forget what I put in the boxes, and I feel overwhelmed by the good vibes that come out of these boxes,"" he says with delight.
Nicolò eats ""like a cow"", as he needs energy for his mission. Lots of fats, no regrets.
“Bread, chocolate, butter, jam. And water, of course. Plenty of water, either directly or through the incredible amount of fruit and veggies that I eat,"" he tells SBS Italian.
Seriously, I eat double the amount I was used to, yet I am losing weight.
""In the desert, I lost seven kilos, I need to look after myself,"" he adds.
When he cooks his meals, Nicolò opts for carbs like pasta. He is Italian, after all.
Rice and proteins like canned legumes and ""good fats"" like avocado also make their way to his plate while he is on the move.

After walking through Ecuador, Peru and Chile, Nicolò landed in Sydney in March.
With Ezio, of course.
But why Australia?
I had travelled to Australia seven years ago and had such a magical moment watching Uluru that I promised I would return, so here I am.
Nicolò Guarrera traverses the rocky terrain of northern Australia Credit: Instagram/Pieroad__ Not all that easy
Nicolò’s fascinating mission may seem like the ideal life to some: full-time tourist, no limitations, no borders.
Freedom at its best, people might think.
But it’s not all that straightforward.
Physical and mental health need to be handled with absolute care and attention in the terrain he traverses.
“I must complete my Australian walk before the end of September as my visa will expire by then. And I am pushing to remain within this timeframe,” says Nicolò.
I had an issue with knee bursitis in Chile, and I need to be very careful. But I also cannot afford to stop completely for a few days.
Straight after finishing his walk through Sydney, Nicolò had the most challenging time.
The rain did not give him a break and his mental health was impacted.
""I kept repeating to myself, ‘why am I here? Why didn’t I stay in Chile, my favourite place',"" he says.
A part of me wanted to quit and being alone might be an impossible cliff to climb in those moments.
Loneliness and silence, according to Nicolò, are “an absolute bliss” most of the time.
“The connection between myself and why and what I am doing is profound,"" he says.
The slow pace of walking reflects another way of interpreting life; this is the best lesson I am learning.
The world at his feet. Credit: Instagram/Pieroad__ Maybe, tomorrow
After Australia, Nicolò will fly to Kolkata, India.
And from there, he will head northwest along River Ganga up to New Delhi.
His way home will now need to be amended, as when he first planned the trip, Ukraine and Russia were not fighting a war.
It will take me another couple of years to return home. Too late to ditch now!
Finally, he is grateful to Australia.
“The people are so kind and hospitable. I have been invited to their homes many times, and for me, it is something priceless, not only because I have the chance to talk to someone, but I can do my laundry and dry my clothes,” Nicolò signs off.

SBS,05AM 26/08/23,"With its leader believed dead, what's next for the complex web that is Wagner?",https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/with-its-leader-believed-dead-whats-next-for-the-complex-web-that-is-wagner/qs73j5nxr,3,"KEY POINTS The fate of the Wagner Group hangs in the balance following the apparent death of its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin.
In Africa, Wagner may stay more or less intact under new management or be subsumed by another Russian mercenary group.
In some ways, it is an invaluable tool of Kremlin foreign policy.
A day before mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin's plane crash, a Russian official visited Libya to reassure allies that fighters from the Wagner Group would remain in the country — but under Moscow's control.
Meeting in Benghazi, Russian Deputy Defence Minister Yunus-Bek Yevkurov told eastern Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar on Tuesday that Wagner forces would report to a new commander, a Libyan official with knowledge of the meeting said.
There's no indication the timing was anything but coincidental. Yet, Yevkurov's visit ""suggests that - if anything - the Russian footprint in Libya might deepen and expand rather than shrink,"" said Libya researcher Jalel Harchaoui of the Royal United Services Institute.
The military meeting, which followed an aborted mutiny by Prigozhin and Wagner forces against Russian President Vladimir Putin in June, was a sign that Moscow does not mean to relinquish the global network the mercenary group built up.
Now with Prigozhin believed dead , the fate of the complex, lucrative web of military and commercial operations he and Wagner created for Russia across Europe, the Middle East and Africa hangs in the balance.
Wagner has waged major battles in Ukraine, fought in civil wars and insurgencies in Syria , Libya, the Central African Republic (CAR) and Mali and taken control of gold mines and oil fields along the way.
Putin had already rolled up Wagner operations in Syria. After the mutiny, Wagner's Ukraine forces handed over a base to Russia's regular military and began relocating to an army camp in Belarus, though it is unclear how many of them are there.
In Africa, Wagner may stay more or less intact under new management or be subsumed by another Russian mercenary group. But its ability to operate in places where Moscow may have no formal or legal presence makes it an invaluable tool of Kremlin foreign policy.
""Wagner is a going concern. There are contracts, it is a business, it needs to continue,"" said John Lechner, a United States-based researcher who is writing a book about Prigozhin.
""From a credibility perspective, (Wagner) will try to give the appearance that things are going on normally, that they are still a partner,"" he said.

Wagner could face 'operational difficulties'
After the June mutiny , Prigozhin intensified his efforts to bolster Wagner's presence in Africa. In a video on Monday from an unnamed African country, he said: ""The Wagner PMC makes Russia even greater on all continents, and Africa - more free"".
That push may not have been welcomed in Moscow and there have been reports of the Kremlin creating alternative companies to take over Wagner operations - though none appear capable of doing so yet.
In countries where Wagner operates through an official agreement with Moscow, analysts do not expect much to change - for now.
In Libya since 2019, as many as 2,000 Wagner guns-for-hire helped Haftar's faction in his assault on Tripoli until a 2020 ceasefire and have guarded military and oil installations according to independent analysts and Human Rights Watch.
As Russia has no official military role in Libya and could not intervene directly without breaking a United Nations arms embargo, its involvement there would still have to be through Wagner or a similar outfit, Harchaoui said.

Source: AAP, SIPA USA / Kommersant Photo Agency A Haftar spokesperson did not respond to questions about the meeting with the Russian official, but earlier said the men discussed military cooperation including coordination on training in Russian weapons. Russia's Defence Ministry had said the talks would look at cooperation in fighting terrorism.
In CAR, President Faustin-Archange Touadera's political adviser Fidele Gouandjika lamented Prigozhin's death as ""a great sadness"" because his men ""helped save democracy"" in their role helping the government in its civil war.
But as Wagner was there through a state-level agreement with Russia, ""nothing will affect the presence of these instructors"" he said. Prigozhin is ""a dead leader, we can replace him"" Gouandjika added.

""We can already imagine the operational difficulties the movement could now face, and it goes without saying that there will be repercussions for the African countries in which it is involved,"" he said.
The fate of Wagner's purely economic - rather than security assets - may be even harder to determine. There has been no information on the fate of Evro Polis, a company Wagner is said to own with oil assets in Syria.
There is little information on how much it makes from its mining and logging businesses in CAR and other African countries. But trying to bring such assets under direct Russian control, or handing them to another contractor, would be difficult.",16,1
SBS,05AM 26/08/23,People in this European country are happy to rent for life. Could Australians ever feel the same?,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/why-doesnt-australia-have-indefinite-tenancies/of3cown0z,2,"Key Points Germany has one of the lowest rates of home ownership in Europe. Less than half of the country are homeowners.
Experts say this is largely driven by regulatory systems that produce incentives to rent long term.
In contrast, Australia's rental and regulatory systems are based on the notion that renting is transitional.
Germany has one of the lowest rates of home ownership in Europe, with only 49.1 per cent of Germans owning their own home.
Experts say this is largely driven by housing policies that produce incentives to rent, such as indefinite tenancy agreements.
In stark contrast to Australia, where the average initial fixed tenancy agreement is for 12 months, German renters are offered initial fixed-term agreements ranging between two to 30 years, with the option for indefinite leases also readily available.

Why is there a stigma around renting?
According to Michael Fotheringham from the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, if we want long-term agreements to be an option in Australia, we have to start with changing the perception of renting.
""Australia has always viewed renting as transitional,"" he said.
""We are still stuck in this 1950s view of the world, where renting is a short-term rite of passage after you leave your family home and you share a house in your twenties for a little while before you buy your own. It's still not being viewed as a long-term solution,"" he said.
""Unfortunately, our rental and regulatory systems are still based on that notion, which is why we don't have the option to opt for long-term leases. And we really should have that ability by now considering how many people in Australia are projected to be lifetime renters."" Fotheringham said.
Financial incentives for real estate agents
With over 70 per cent of rentals managed by real estate agents in Australia, Fotheringham says the financial incentive for agents is also largely to blame for Australians not having access to initial long-term lease agreements.
""Our rental systems haven't looked for long-term security,"" he said.
""Real estate agents have a financial incentive when re-letting and maintaining a property. In countries like Germany, landlords letting and managing their own properties is the norm.""
Short lease terms and the lower security that comes with them, partly reflect the market structure in Australia and the 'Mum and Dad investor' owners who own rental properties.
Owners in Australia are more likely to need the property for some other purpose, such as living in it themselves at some stage, unlike corporate owners, which are more common in Europe.
Australia's short tenancy agreements are largely driven by financial incentives received by real estate agents, according to experts. Source: AAP / JAMES ROSS/AAPIMAGE
Tax incentives lead to shorter leases
According to PropTrack senior economist Paul Ryan, Australia's investment property tax incentives are also a significant cause of short-term lease offerings, with generous minimum thresholds and capital gains tax discounts for owners resulting in 70 per cent of investors owning at least one rental property.
“Providing longer leases, and more security of tenure for tenants would go a long way towards making renting a long-term prospect for Australians,"" he said.",15,1
The Guardian,05AM 26/08/23,What does the removal of Prigozhin and Surovikin mean for the war in Ukraine?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/24/what-does-the-removal-of-prigozhin-and-surovikin-mean-for-the-war-in-ukraine,10,"Yevgeny Prigozhin apparently being killed on the same day that it emerged Gen Sergei Surovikin had been relieved of his command of Russia’s air force means the two most effective leaders in the first phase of the Ukraine war are now gone; their removal a victory of sorts for the old guard at the Kremlin.
The Wagner group, headed by Prigozhin, led the capture of Bakhmut, Russia’s only battlefield gain so far this year, and it was his ally Surovikin, in his short period of overall command in Ukraine, who began building the defensive fortifications that are seen as so important to the invader’s position today.
However, the conduct of the invasion has changed since the fall of Bakhmut and Prigozhin’s brief, failed rebellion at the end of June. Wagner’s 15,000-strong light infantry force has been absent from the battle since late May, and after the rebellion has been effectively broken up.
Surovikin, already demoted from overall command, has been out of commission and possibly imprisoned since June, given his close relationship with Prigozhin and his presence in Rostov, where the short-lived Wagner march to Moscow began.
In other words, Russia’s military command in Ukraine had already consolidated around the veteran defence minister Sergei Shoigu, and the chief of staff, Valery Gerasimov, several months ago. And it would be a mistake to write them off.
While Ukraine’s counter-offensive is continuing to make slow progress on the southern Zaporizhzhia front, and even in the east around Bakhmut, the Russians are showing they are not just in defensive mode.
02:07 From Putin's 'chef' to Wagner chief: timeline of Prigozhin's relationship with Russian president
At the beginning of August, Russian forces launched another artillery-led offensive aimed at Kupiansk, on the northern part of the eastern front, and from there south, towards Lyman. Territorial gains have been modest, a couple of miles in the middle of the month, but Ukraine has been forced to shore up its lines.
Russia has also improved its military effectiveness as the war has dragged on, mostly on the defensive side. For example, its dense mine-laying, which has blunted Ukraine’s advances, and its anti-drone electronic warfare forces have forced Kyiv’s cash-strapped military to constantly innovate.
Whether Moscow’s offensive performance has improved is less clear, but the sector around Kupiansk does have the advantage of being close to Russia and it may prove easier to resupply there than in the south or Crimea, where logistics targets are being hit with British and French Storm Shadow missiles.
The elimination of Prigozhin also helps, for the moment, to shore up unity in Moscow, which is central to Russia’s war effort. Orysia Lutsevych, a deputy director with the Chatham House thinktank, said: “How will this war end? What happens domestically in Russia is equally important as what happens on the battlefield.”
Prigozhin’s abortive mutiny in June was the one moment in the past 18 months when Ukrainians thought the invasion of their country might be halted. The Wagner boss was the only significant Russian political figure with a profile independent of the Kremlin, and for a moment it looked as if he might march into Moscow.

Remarkably, Prigozhin was not arrested afterwards. Instead, as part of a deal struck with President Vladimir Putin, it appeared he might go into exile in Belarus, or at least avoid publicity. But his appearance at an Africa summit at the Kremlin and a video released this week of the warlord apparently in the Sahel, calling for recruits, showed he thought he could continue to be a player.
Allowing him to rebuild his position would always be a threat. Prigozhin, after all, was the man who, during the revolt, criticised the war in Ukraine as being started by a “clan of oligarchs”, and dismissed the notion that Kyiv had attacked Russia.
Few expect the Wagner operation to remain in Europe. A rump in Belarus is reported, by Ukraine’s National Resistance Centre, to be packing up to head back to Russia, although Minsk’s security forces are trying to stop them. Their presence had a nuisance value, forcing Poland and Lithuania to increase their border security, but there was no real prospect of an attack on a Nato member state.
The problem for Moscow is that, while it may be possible to eliminate Prigozhin and his allies, and break up his paramilitary group, it will be harder to eradicate what made Wagner popular in parts of Russian society. The remote elite stand in sharp contrast to Prigozhin’s direct style on social media.
Lutsevych argues that pro-Wagner sentiment, and populist criticisms of the war in Ukraine, are now likely to go underground. “Putin will have to keep watching his back for traitors within the military, and that distracts from the war,” she said.",13,1
The Guardian,05AM 26/08/23,Trump’s Tucker Carlson segment was bizarre and boring at the same time,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/24/trump-tucker-carlson-interview,9,"Scientists recently revealed that they revived a worm that was frozen in the Siberian permafrost 46,000 years ago. This was obviously a totally unnecessary and reckless exercise.
Because barely a month later Tucker Carlson would revive the semi-frozen carcass of an ex-president from the Twitter permafrost that is now weirdly known as X. Anyone who has watched a Jeff Goldblum movie knows how badly these experiments can turn out.
Cryogenic revivals are a relatively new medical procedure, which might explain Carlson’s sitting in what looked like a pine-lined Swedish sauna at the Trump golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Then again, Donald Trump did not exactly find himself in a hot seat beside the former primetime star of the Fox “News” Channel.
“Why aren’t you at the Fox News debate tonight in Milwaukee?” probed Carlson.
“Well, you know, a lot of people have been asking me that,” began the semi-conscious Siberian worm, “and many people said you shouldn’t do it, but you see the polls have come out and I’m leading by 50 and 60 points, and you know some of [the other candidates] are at one and zero and two, and I’m saying, do I sit there for an hour or two hours whatever it’s going to be and get harassed by people that shouldn’t even be running for president, should I be doing that, and a network that isn’t particularly friendly to me, frankly …”
We can all seem groggy after a long sleep, but this so-called populist was positively Jeb Bushy in his energy levels during the slobbering snoozefest that tried to rival the first Republican debate of the 2024 cycle.
In this episode of Good Night America With Tucker and Donald, the only risk he faced was sending the Maga movement to sleep.
“It’s interesting because you spent a lot of your career in television,” Tucker the Torquemada continued, “but you don’t feel the need now running for president to do television obviously. Do you think television is declining?”
If anything captures the core burning resentment of the Maga mob, it’s surely their hatred of immigrants, the loss of economic security and the decline of television as we know it. Who among us does not hanker for the days of smoke-pumping steel mills, full church pews and endless reruns of Little House on the Prairie?
Trump answered with all the gusto he could muster. “Well, according to a poll that I guess we just saw, it just came out, where it’s down like 30, 35% but I think they were talking, referring to cable, I think cable is down because it’s lost credibility. MSNBC, or as they say, MS-DNC, is so bad. It’s so wrong what they write and what they do and what they say. You know, it’s fake news, as I said. I think I came up with that term. I hope I did, because it’s a good one. It’s not tough enough any more. It’s corrupt news.”
This was a strange way to rally the rioting crowds that Trump hopes will keep him out of jail for the rest of his living days.
But surely a twinge of irony crossed Tucker’s permanently furrowed brow as Donald talked about fake news to the anchor who lost his Fox News gig in part for lying about a stolen election and a voting machine company that led to a $787m settlement.
Surely not.
“The good old days are long ago,” lamented Trump as he continued to shed fake tears for Fox’s declining ratings. “I will say this. It could come back but they just don’t have a lot of credibility, Tucker, you know that perhaps better than anybody. I think it was a terrible move getting rid of you. You were number one on television and all of a sudden we’re doing this interview, but we’ll get bigger ratings using this crazy forum that you’re using than probably, probably the debate, our competition.”
You know your career is circling the drain when your big interview guest spends his time reminiscing about the good old days when you were number one, long before you ended up on this crazy website, whatever it’s called nowadays, where we maybe, possibly, probably will do better than the debate.
For what it’s worth, despite all the incoherent blather that spills out of Trump’s mouth like endless rain into a paper cup, his fans believe. They truly, deeply believe every morsel of moronic nonsense that he plucks out of the ether that separates his brain cells.
A recent CBS News poll revealed that Trump voters trust the twice-impeached, quadruple-indicted ex-president more than their own friends, family, religious leaders, and even (gulp) conservative media figures like Tucker Carlson.
Listening to the two of them talk on Thursday night, you can understand why.
Tucker asked Trump not once but twice why his attorney general Bill Barr thought that the notorious rapist Jeffrey Epstein had killed himself in prison. Donald tried to pivot to Barr’s real crime: his failure to “investigate” the 2020 election. But Tucker persisted, like the rottweiler interviewer he is.
“I think he probably committed suicide,” said Trump.
Tucker asked Donald not once but twice if he thought that after impeachment and indictment, the left was surely going to try to kill him. As in, literally assassinate him.
Donald just said they were savage animals and left it there, hanging in the Twitter/X space like the promise of self-driving Teslas.
Sure, sure. There was plenty of weird stuff from Donald. He called Asa Hutchinson, the former Arkansas governor, “Ada”, and described Hutchinson as a seriously nasty thing that was so nasty he couldn’t explain why. He called Chris Christie a lunatic. He said Joe Biden couldn’t walk on grass or sand.
He even claimed to have saved the Tokyo Olympics by getting North Korean athletes to take part. Which is the kind of thing that can haunt you, late at night, if you try too hard to understand what he’s saying.
But then Tucker said Biden had skinny legs, and Kamala Harris was senile too, and that one of his old Fox News co-workers was a small man. He even claimed that Trump’s indictments weren’t “working” because Trump’s poll numbers were going up. Which isn’t how indictments are supposed to work – at least not in the criminal justice system.
Elon Musk likes to say that he is protecting the digital town square by destroying Twitter as we knew it. But the corner of this square that is populated by Tucker and Donald needs a little more protection.
Some things are best left unthawed, buried deep in the crevasses of the internet with all the other frozen worms, lamenting the decline of cable television and the death of Jeffrey Epstein.",12,1
The Guardian,05AM 26/08/23,What we know about Prigozhin’s ‘last flight’ – a visual guide,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/24/what-we-know-about-yevgeny-prigozhin-last-flight-a-visual-guide,7,"The aircraft on which Yevgeny Prigozhin was travelling had long been linked with the Wagner group. An Embraer Legacy 600 jet, the flight tracking service FlightRadar identified it as being in regular use in recent months, flying from both St Petersburg and Moscow.
According to some reports, the Wagner party on board had been attending a meeting with officials from Russia’s defence ministry.
The aircraft, manufactured in 2007, fell under US Treasury sanctions in 2019 when it was listed under a prior registration, M-SAAN, according to a US government press release.
It said that by October 2018, Prigozhin’s employees had arranged for the purchase of the private jet M-SAAN, which was registered to the owner Autolex Transport, a company cited in the release for materially assisting the Wagner chief.
Flight data reviewed by the Guardian showed the jet – tail number RA-02795 – was logged taking off from Moscow at 5.46pm local time (15.46 UK), and climbing to a cruising altitude of 28,000 ft, outside the range of many small anti-aircraft missiles.
Thirty-three minutes into the flight, while about a mile south of the village of Kuzhenkino in the Tver region, the aircraft rapidly lost altitude and lost contact. Amateur footage showed what appeared to be the jet falling from the sky. Villagers on the ground reported hearing a loud metallic bang and seeing the jet land in several pieces in a field.
Weather conditions during the short flight were reported to be good.
What caused the crash?
Prigozhin supporters claimed on pro-Wagner messaging app channels that the plane had been deliberately downed. Some suggested it could have been hit by an air-defence missile, or targeted by a bomb on board. These claims could not be independently verified. Numerous opponents and critics of Vladimir Putin have been killed or gravely sickened in apparent assassination attempts.

Witnesses and experts who have reviewed video footage of the incident describe a break-up in mid-air associated with some kind of explosion, either originating within the jet, suggesting a bomb or catastrophic failure, or from outside, suggesting a missile strike.
Footage of the incident is inconclusive, even when broken down frame by frame. In one video, vapour resembling a missile contrail may be visible, and some witnesses on the ground spoke of hearing two explosions.
What is clear is that the blast was powerful enough to separate one wing section of the jet from the fuselage. Low-quality images of the wreckage of the aircraft on the ground suggest there may be holes in parts of the fuselage.

Vitaly Stepenok, 72, a Kuzhenkino resident, described what he saw. “I hear an explosion or a bang … and I looked up and saw white smoke. One wing flew off in one direction … and then it glided down on one wing. It didn’t nosedive, it was gliding.”
Western sources, including the US president, Joe Biden, have pointed to Putin’s potential role in the incident. . The French government’s spokesperson, Olivier Véran, told France 2 television:
“We don’t yet know the circumstances of this crash. We can have some reasonable doubts.”

Russia’s aviation authority offered no comment on the reason for the crash and said it had created a special commission to investigate “the circumstances and causes of the accident”.
What are the chances it was an accident?
There has only been one recorded accident involving an Embraer Legacy 600, and that involved a mid-air collision which the jet survived. There have been no recorded accidents involving mechanical failure.

There were unconfirmed reports that the aircraft had undergone repairs just before its last flight. Because of sanctions, Embraer, the Brazilian maker of the Legacy 600, said it had stopped providing support for the aircraft in 2019.
Who are the other Wagner group leaders presumed dead in the crash?
According to the official passenger list published by Rosaviatsia, the Russian aviation authority, several other senior Wagner members were on the plane with Prigozhin.
Among them was Dmitry Utkin, who was often described as the founder or co-founder of the mercenary group, although his exact role was disputed.

His own call sign was “Wagner”, after Hitler’s favourite composer. The investigative website Bellingcat wrote in 2020 that Utkin had “an obsessive fascination with the history of the Third Reich” while another recent report described him as “festooned with numerous Nazi tattoos, including a swastika, a Nazi eagle, and SS lightning bolts”. The Wagner group was apparently named after him.
Rarely seen or heard from in public, he was last seen in a video posted by Prigozhin in July, in which the Wagner boss addressed fighters in Belarus, where they were sent after their aborted mutiny a month earlier. In the video, Prigozhin introduces a man he says is Utkin; it was the first time the commander had been filmed speaking to his troops.
“This is not the end, this is only the beginning of the greatest work in the world, which will continue very soon,” Utkin says in the video. “And welcome to hell,” he adds, speaking the last words in English.
Valery Chekalov was also listed on the passenger list. A longtime Prigohzin ally, Chekalov was said to be overseeing Priogzhin’s catering firm that provided food for schools across Russia and fed the military. He also reportedly managed some of Prigozhin’s business assets in Syria, including his investment in oil in the war-torn country.
According to Russian independent media, Chekalov was also in charge of Prigozhin’s travel arrangements, making him one of the only people aware of the warlord’s secretive movements, and was responsible for Prigozhin’s personal security. He had been accused by journalists of leading harassment campaigns against them. The US imposed sanctions on Chekalov last month over his links to Prigozhin and for facilitating munitions shipments to Russia.
Another commander on board was Evgeniy Makaryan, who joined Wagner in 2016 and fought as part of the mercenary group during Russia’s intervention in Syria. He was reportedly injured in the Battle of Khasham, where hundreds of Russian mercenaries perished after US airstrikes against pro-Assad forces.
Members of Prigozhin’s personal security guard were also listed among the passengers killed, including Sergey Propustin, a Chechen war veteran who joined Wagner in 2015.
Although the crash killed much of Wagner’s leadership, a number of veteran commanders remain alive. But they lack Prigozhin’s charisma, economic powers and political connections, raising serious questions over the mercenary group’s future.",11,1
The Guardian,05AM 26/08/23,Ruthless bear who can do no wrong: a love letter to Tottenham’s Ange Postecoglou,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/24/ruthless-bear-who-can-do-no-wrong-love-letter-ange-postecoglou-tottenham,6,"It seems sensible to write the Ange Postecoglou love letter while Spurs are still unbeaten. Anyone with a passing interest in all this knows it could come crashing down at the Vitality early on Saturday afternoon. Lads, it’s … etc etc … But for now this empathic caring gruff ruthless bear of a man can do no wrong.
What a difference it makes to have a manager who looks like they want to be there, rather than doing everyone a favour. A boss who doesn’t instantly criticise his players, the officials, the last thing he saw. The toxic reigns of José Mourinho and Antonio Conte were all a bit “I love lamp” – just marginally more negative than Steve Carell. “I blame microphone, I blame Geoff Shreeves, I blame unused sub [probably Djed Spence] warming down in my peripheral vision.”
There was a telling interview in pre-season after a defeat against West Ham, when Spurs conceded some typically soft goals. “That’s on me,” Postecoglou said. Three very simple words, but extraordinarily how refreshing to hear a manager taking responsibility. It appears he neither owns a bus to throw his players under nor one to park.
There’s the ruthlessness of someone who’s been hugely successful almost everywhere he’s been. In the same interview, the chirpy social media guy tried to temper the defeat, “results don’t matter”. Postecoglou cut him down with one look and one terse sentence. “Results always matter mate.” That voice. So tough, but so comforting, instantly demoting Sean Dyche and Eddie Jones down the gruffness pecking order. Somewhere up there, Joe Cocker is getting nervous.
It is that hard edge that has (admittedly not entirely through choice) disposed of the entire senior leadership team of the previous years. Harry Kane, Hugo Lloris, Pierre-Emile Højbjerg, Eric Dier are out or on the way out. Only Kane would have remained firmly in his plans. The others don’t fit his style – and what style. A team that for three years had the fluidity of a foosball table in a static low block suddenly passes the ball (sometimes even forwards), and then moves to some other part of the pitch to receive it again.
OK, the bar has been set pretty low – and a 2-2 draw at Brentford is the same result as last year – but the performance was just so different. It reminded me of the day Cambridge United’s manager John Beck decided to start playing passing football after years of just hitting the channels. From kick-off, the ball was rolled to centre-back Phil Chapple. Instead of getting it launched, he played a 10-yard pass across the floor to the right-back, Andy Fensome. The stadium gasped in excitement, the applause seemed to go on for ever.
The most telling moment of Postecoglou’s first game was the substitution of the concussed Cristian Romero after 14 minutes despite the Argentinian wanting to stay on. To break up your back four so early into your first game, when the pressure is so great – and knowing how quickly it mounts if you do not get a result – is hugely significant. Is this finally a manager who puts player welfare above that day’s result? Will he stop them in flight towards the brick wall? “Nah look mate. You don’t want to run through that for me.” Would other managers have done the same?
“We’re in an era where we know about these things so I’m not a doctor and anytime that happens it’s really important that we protect the players,” he said. “They don’t know themselves what’s going on and I had medical advice.” Ange even listens to experts. After Spurs, perhaps he could run the country.

Already the players are blossoming. Yves Bissouma looks like Brighton Yves Bissouma. James Maddison is so extraordinarily Spurs. Emerson Royal – whose previous jobs have been to conceding unnecessary free-kicks and crossing the ball out for goal kicks – could be seen popping it around in central midfield in the opening game.
Perhaps it should not be a surprise that professional footballers can adapt quickly. It is unlikely they spent their youth careers without the ball, hoping for the occasional counterattack. And yet the paradigm shift in a couple of months feels almost overpowering. What a relief for the forward players to get the ball more than twice a half.

It is the role of fans to get completely carried away. Manchester United could easily have won at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. This is a work in progress. Guglielmo Vicario is moderately terrifying with the ball at his feet. Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski don’t naturally hug the touchline, which is where Postecoglou likes his wingers. Richarlison needs to get a bigger backside, so one can go in off it to get things rolling. Postecoglou must know Mark Viduka, perhaps he could borrow his, the greatest of all.
None of this comes as a surprise to someone who’s lived in Australia for the past couple of years. Since arriving, every radio interview, almost every footballing conversation has begun with a review of how Postecoglou was doing at Celtic. He is the superstar of Australian men’s football. While the Matildas have Sam Kerr, the Socceroos have no one who could be regarded as truly elite.
As a result, I was calling for Postecoglou to get the Spurs job from the moment Conte left, to the point where a number of (well, two) Celtic fans hold me responsible – not sure that’s within my power. For a finger rarely anywhere near the pulse perhaps this time I was right. Even a stopped clock and all that.
Last year, no one expected Arsenal to mount a title challenge and realistically no one expects Spurs to this year. But the vibes are good. And vibes matter. Angeball might be the Bazball of the Premier League. Make everyone happy, enjoy yourself doing it and the results might just follow.
I have long come to the conclusion that results don’t really matter (typical Spurs blah, blah, blah – you don’t need to fill up my replies with that). Really, we’re all just trying to have a nice day and if your team is entertaining you that’s only going to help and then who knows?",10,1
ABC,05AM 26/08/23,Matildas go from fourth in the World Cup to 11th in the world rankings,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-08-25/matildas-drop-in-womens-fifa-rankings-after-world-cup/102779072,1,"The Matildas have dropped a place in FIFA's women's rankings despite their fourth-placed finish at their home World Cup, while captain Sam Kerr is in the running to be named UEFA's best player.
Key points: Kerr is one of three finalists for the player of the year award handed out by European football's governing body

Ranked 10th in the world heading into the tournament, Kerr's team has slipped to 11th in the world, marking the first time this year they have been outside the top 10.
2011 world champions Japan leapfrogged Australia, jumping from 11th to eighth, despite being eliminated by Sweden in the quarterfinals.
Sweden also beat the Matildas in the third-place playoff after both teams lost their semifinals to Spain and England respectively.
That win over Australia moved Sweden from third into top spot on the rankings for the first time ever, while Spain's victory in the final pushed them from sixth to second.

The United States drops from first to third after being eliminated on penalties in the round of 16 by Sweden, while World Cup finalist England held firm at fourth.
Australia was 10th in the women's world rankings released in June and March, up from 12th in December last year.
Since the June rankings, Australia played just one game before the World Cup, beating France 1-0, before recording four wins and three losses at the tournament proper.
Ranking points are calculated based on match results, the quality of opponents and the importance of matches.
The Matildas have an all-time high of fourth in the world, achieved in 2017, but had not made it past the World Cup quarterfinals until this year.
A calf injury prevented captain Kerr from playing in the group stage of the Cup, but she still scored one of the goals of the tournament in Australia's semifinal loss to England.
Now she is one of three finalists for the UEFA women's player of the year, given to the best player who competes in a European league.
The 29-year-old is up against a couple of World Cup-winning Spanish stars — player of the tournament Aitana Bonmatí and victorious captain Olga Carmona.
Kerr has never been in the top three for the European award, which will be handed out on August 31, with her best finish seventh in 2020/21.
Kerr's 2022/23 season with Chelsea was elite, scoring 24 goals across the Blues' victorious Women's Super League and FA Cup campaigns.",0,1
